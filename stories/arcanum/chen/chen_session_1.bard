You're in your apartment reading corner.

Rain drums steadily against the window - Seattle's perpetual lullaby. Your tarot deck sits on the small folding table, wrapped in a thrift-store scarf you've claimed as a reading cloth. A single candle flickers beside it (unscented, dollar store, but it's the thought that counts).

Your phone buzzes.

**[Text from: 206-555-0139]**
*"Hello dear. I'm downstairs. Margaret Chen. Take your time, no rush. - M"*

Your stomach flips.

Your first real client.

Not Alex, who you practice on while they roll their eyes affectionately. Not yourself, reading cards at 2 AM when sleep won't come.

A stranger. Someone who found your Craigslist ad. Someone who's paying you. Someone who needs something you might not be able to give.

You buzz her in.

The intercom crackles: *"Thank you, dear. I'll be up in a moment."*

+ [Wait by the door, try to look professional] -> Chen.Session1.ArrivalComposed
+ [Frantically straighten the reading space] -> Chen.Session1.ArrivalNervous
+ [Take a deep breath, center yourself] -> Chen.Session1.ArrivalCentered

:: Chen.Session1.ArrivalComposed
~ reader.competence += 1  // Maintaining professional demeanor
You stand by the door, trying to look like someone who knows what they're doing.

Professional reader. Totally calm. Definitely not having a minor panic attack.

Footsteps on the stairs - measured, careful, unhurried.

A soft knock.

+ [Open the door.] -> Chen.Session1.FirstImpression

:: Chen.Session1.ArrivalNervous
You rush to your reading corner.

Is the cloth straight? Should you light more candles? Where's your book - no, wait, you're not supposed to need the book, you're supposed to just *know* things, except you DON'T just know things, you learned from a BOOK—

Footsteps on the stairs interrupt your spiral.

A knock.

You smooth your hair, take a breath.

+ [Open the door, flustered.] -> Chen.Session1.FirstImpression

:: Chen.Session1.ArrivalCentered
~ reader.competence += 1  // Good self-regulation
~ session.atmosphere += 1  // Better starting energy
You close your eyes.

Breathe in: four counts.
Hold: four counts.
Breathe out: six counts.

*I know what I'm doing. I've practiced. The cards will guide me.*

Another breath.

Footsteps on the stairs. Measured. Patient.

A knock.

+ [Open the door, calm and ready.] -> Chen.Session1.FirstImpression

:: Chen.Session1.FirstImpression
**Margaret Chen** stands in your doorway.

Small frame - maybe five-foot-two in her sensible flats. Silver-grey hair pulled into a neat bun. She wears a burgundy cardigan over a cream blouse, black slacks. Elegant without trying, the way some people just *are*.

In one hand: a stainless steel thermos.
In a fabric shopping bag: something that smells... warm. Like custard.

When she smiles, it reaches her eyes - warm, real, slightly crinkled at the corners.

"Hello. You must be {reader.name}. I'm chen. May I come in?"

Her voice is soft but clear. Unaccented English, but there's a particular cadence to it - the rhythm of someone who thinks in one language and speaks in another.

+ ["Yes! Of course. Please, come in."] -> Chen.Session1.EntersWelcoming
+ ["I'm a little nervous - this is my first real client."] -> Chen.Session1.EntersHonest
+ ["Welcome. Can I take your coat?"] -> Chen.Session1.EntersFormal

:: Chen.Session1.EntersWelcoming
~ chen.comfort += 5 // Warm welcome puts her at ease
"Yes! Of course. Please, come in."

She steps inside, glancing around your apartment with the assessing eye of someone who notices everything. Not judging - just *seeing*.

Her gaze lands on your reading corner. The folding table. The candle. The deck.

"Oh," she says softly. "You've made it sacred. M. Thorne would approve."

+ ["You... you knew M. Thorne?"] -> Chen.Session1.MThorneReveal

:: Chen.Session1.EntersHonest
~ chen.trust += 5  // Honesty builds trust
~ chen.comfort += 5  // Your vulnerability makes her comfortable
"I'm a little nervous," you admit. "This is my first real client."

Margaret's smile deepens - something knowing and kind.

"Good. Nervousness means you care." She steps inside. "*Aiya*, if you weren't nervous, I'd worry you were overconfident."

She notices your reading corner - the careful arrangement, the candle, the deck.

"You've prepared well. M. Thorne would be pleased."

+ ["M. Thorne? You knew them?"] -> Chen.Session1.MThorneReveal

:: Chen.Session1.EntersFormal
"Welcome. Can I take your coat?"

"Oh, I'm not wearing one. But thank you." She steps inside, polite but slightly formal in return.

She glances at your reading space. Nods approvingly.

"Simple but intentional. Good."

There's a small pause - the slight awkwardness of two strangers not quite sure how to begin.

Then she notices your deck. Her expression softens.

"That deck... M. Thorne had the same one."

+ ["You knew M. Thorne?"] -> Chen.Session1.MThorneReveal

:: Chen.Session1.MThorneReveal
Margaret sets down her thermos and bag carefully on your small table.

"For thirty-four years. Since 1989." She looks at you directly - assessing, but kind. "Monthly readings. Sometimes more often when..." She trails off. "Well. When life was difficult."

She unwinds a scarf from around the handles of her bag.

"When they retired last year, they told me: 'Someone will inherit the practice. Someone with a good heart and willingness to learn. Help them when they start. Be patient. They'll be nervous.'"

A pause.

"So here I am."

The weight of it settles on you. This isn't random. Margaret came *specifically* to be your first client. To help you learn.

+ ["Thank you. For being here. For being patient with me."] -> Chen.Session1.Thankful
+ ["Did they tell you anything else about me?"] -> Chen.Session1.Curious
+ ["That's... that's a lot of pressure actually."] -> Chen.Session1.Pressured

:: Chen.Session1.Thankful
~ chen.trust += 5
~ chen.comfort += 5
~ reader.empathy += 1
"Thank you. For being here. For being patient with me."

Margaret's expression softens further.

"Don't thank me yet, dear. I still need an actual reading." She picks up the thermos. "But first - tea. You have cups?"

+ [Nod and fetch the cups. "Of course. Right away."] -> Chen.Session1.TeaRitual

:: Chen.Session1.Curious
~ chen.trust += 5
"Did they tell you anything else about me?"

"No. They kept perfect confidence - never spoke about their clients, never spoke about their successor." She smiles slightly. "They said: 'You'll know them when you meet them. They'll have the eyes of someone who sees patterns.'"

She tilts her head, studying you.

"You do. See patterns, I mean."

"Now - tea. You have cups?"

+ ["Yes, coming right up."] -> Chen.Session1.TeaRitual

:: Chen.Session1.Pressured
~ chen.comfort += 5
~ session.atmosphere += 1  // Her humor lightens the mood
"That's... that's a lot of pressure actually."

Margaret laughs - soft and genuine.

"*Aiya*, I'm not here to test you! I just need reading. *Ma fan*." She waves a hand dismissively. "M. Thorne said 'help them learn.' This means: be patient, be honest, don't expect perfection. I don't expect perfection."

Her eyes twinkle.

"I expect *tea*. You have cups?"

+ [You laugh with her. "Tea. Yes. I have cups."] -> Chen.Session1.TeaRitual

:: Chen.Session1.TeaRitual
You fetch two mugs from your tiny kitchen - mismatched, one says "I ♥ Seattle" (ironic gift from Alex), the other is plain white (also from Alex, who apparently thinks you need more dishware).

Margaret unscrews her thermos. The scent hits immediately - earthy, rich, deep. Almost smoky.

"Pu-erh tea. You know it?"

+ ["I've heard of it, yes."] -> Chen.Session1.TeaKnowledge
+ ["No, I don't think so."] -> Chen.Session1.TeaExplain
+ {reader.style == "analytical"} ["Is that the aged tea from Yunnan? Post-fermented?"] -> Chen.Session1.TeaAnalytical
+ {reader.style != "analytical"} ["Is that the aged tea from Yunnan?"] -> Chen.Session1.TeaExplain // Fallback for non-analytical style

:: Chen.Session1.TeaKnowledge
"I've heard of it, yes."

"*Mm*." She pours carefully, both hands on the thermos - a small ritual of respect. "This one is fifteen years old. Gets better with time."

The tea is dark, almost reddish-brown. Steam curls up.

"M. Thorne understood tea. Most *gweilo* readers—" she says the Cantonese word casually, not unkindly, "—they offer chamomile. English Breakfast. Safe teas."

She pours yours first, then her own. Passes your mug with both hands.

"But pu-erh... this is patient tea. Cannot rush. Must steep properly. Like good readings."

+ [(Take the mug respectfully.) "Thank you. It smells amazing."] -> Chen.Session1.TeaContinue

:: Chen.Session1.TeaExplain
"No, I don't think so."

"Is aged tea. From Yunnan province." She pours with both hands, careful and deliberate. "This one is fifteen years old. Like wine - gets better with age."

The liquid is dark, almost red-brown. The scent is earthy and grounding.

She pours yours first (both hands, a small gesture of respect), then her own.

"In Hong Kong, we don't rush tea. Take time. Breathe. Let the leaves open." She meets your eyes. "Same with cards. Cannot rush. Must let the reading breathe."

+ [(Sip the tea.) "It's... grounding."] -> Chen.Session1.TeaContinue

:: Chen.Session1.TeaAnalytical
# This choice is only available if reader.style == "analytical"
~ chen.trust += 5  // Impressed by knowledge
~ chen.comfort += 5
"Is that the aged tea from Yunnan? Post-fermented?"

Margaret's eyebrows rise, pleased.

"*Wah*, you know your tea! Yes. Post-fermented. This one is fifteen years old - *sheng* pu-erh, raw style. You know the difference between *sheng* and *shou*?"

+ ["Sheng is raw-aged, shou is cooked-fermented, right?"] -> Chen.Session1.TeaAnalytical_knowledge
+ ["I've read about it but never tried either."] -> Chen.Session1.TeaAnalytical_never_tried

:: Chen.Session1.TeaAnalytical_knowledge
~ reader.competence += 1
"Exactly! You did research. Good." She pours carefully. "Most Americans only know shou - the dark, smooth one. But sheng... more complex. More *interesting*."

+ [Pick up the cup] -> Chen.Session1.TeaContinue

:: Chen.Session1.TeaAnalytical_never_tried
# OKAY - honest
"Then today you learn. Sheng is raw-aged - more astringent, more complexity. Shou is cooked-fermented - smooth, earthy, easy." She pours. "I prefer sheng. More challenge."

+ [Pick up the cup] -> Chen.Session1.TeaContinue

:: Chen.Session1.TeaContinue
You sip.

It's earthy and smooth and grounding.

Not like green tea's brightness or black tea's briskness. This is... deep. Ancient.

The taste of stone and forest and time.

The nervousness in your chest eases slightly.

Margaret settles into the chair across from you, cradling her mug.

"So." She takes a small sip.

"How did you begin this? M. Thorne always said everyone has a different door into this world. What was yours?"

+ {reader.background == "inheritance"} ["It's a family tradition. My grandmother taught me."] -> Chen.Session1.Learned_Grandmother
+ {reader.background == "career_change"} ["I was a therapist. I started using cards with clients and... it took over."] -> Chen.Session1.Learned_Therapist
+ {reader.background == "self_taught"} ["I taught myself, mostly. Books, online videos. I'm still learning."] -> Chen.Session1.Learned_SelfTaught
+ {reader.background == "unexpected_gift"} ["I... don't really know. The cards just started speaking to me one day."] -> Chen.Session1.Learned_Mystic

# ============================================================================
# LEARNING PATH 1: GRANDMOTHER
# ============================================================================

:: Chen.Session1.Learned_Grandmother
"My grandmother. It's... a family thing, on her side."

"Ah." Margaret nods, pleased. "A lineage. That is good. Structure. Tradition. Was she a good teacher?"

+ ["She was very strict. 'Get it right. The cards are not a toy.'"] -> Chen.Session1.Grandmother_Strict
+ ["She was gentle. 'Listen to what they're whispering, *mija*.'"] -> Chen.Session1.Grandmother_Gentle
+ ["I... didn't appreciate it until after she was gone."] -> Chen.Session1.Grandmother_Regret

:: Chen.Session1.Grandmother_Strict
~ chen.trust += 10
~ reader.competence += 1
Margaret nods approvingly. "Good. This work needs discipline. It is not a game. M. Thorne would have liked your grandmother."

She sips her tea. "They always said, 'Respect the system first, then you can break the rules.' You have good foundation."

+ ["I try to honor that. So, what brought you here today?"] -> Chen.Session1.Question

:: Chen.Session1.Grandmother_Gentle
~ chen.trust += 5
~ chen.comfort += 10
~ reader.empathy += 1
Margaret smiles warmly. "Kindness is also a discipline. A harder one, sometimes."
She looks at your deck. "M. Thorne always said the cards are sharp. It is good to have a gentle hand to hold them."

+ ["I hope I can. What can I help you with?"] -> Chen.Session1.Question

:: Chen.Session1.Grandmother_Regret
~ chen.trust += 10
~ chen.comfort += 5
~ reader.empathy += 1
Margaret's expression softens. "We rarely do, when we are young."
She looks into her cup. "We think they will be there forever to teach us. And then... they are gone. And we are left with what we remember."

"It is a good way to honor her, continuing the work."

+ ["I hope so. What can I help you with today?"] -> Chen.Session1.Question

# ============================================================================
# LEARNING PATH 2: THERAPIST
# ============================================================================

:: Chen.Session1.Learned_Therapist
"I was a therapist, actually. A clinical social worker. I started using tarot in my practice, just as prompts... and it... well, it became more important."

Margaret's eyebrows rise. "*Wah*. A therapist! That is a very strong foundation. Ethics. Boundaries. How to listen to what is *not* said."
She studies you. "But you left that. To do... this. Full time? That is a big leap."

+ ["I felt I was doing more real work with the cards than with the DSM."] -> Chen.Session1.Therapist_RealWork
+ ["Burnout. The system is broken. This felt more honest, more direct."] -> Chen.Session1.Therapist_Burnout
+ ["I'm... still figuring out if it was the right leap."] -> Chen.Session1.Therapist_Honest

:: Chen.Session1.Therapist_RealWork
~ chen.trust += 10
~ reader.competence += 2
~ reader.empathy += 1
"More *direct* work, maybe," Margaret muses. "Less paperwork, more... soul."
She nods. "M. Thorne would respect that. They called this 'soul work.' You have a good background for it. You know how to hold space for difficult things."

+ ["I hope so. What difficult thing can I help you with today?"] -> Chen.Session1.Question

:: Chen.Session1.Therapist_Burnout
~ chen.trust += 5
~ chen.comfort += 10
~ reader.empathy += 2
"*Aiya*, burnout." She shakes her head, sympathetic. "The helpers always forget to help themselves. Yes, honest work is good work. Better to do this, where you can set your own rules, than to break yourself against a wall that will not move."

"I am glad you found your way here."

+ ["Me too. What can I help you with today?"] -> Chen.Session1.Question

:: Chen.Session1.Therapist_Honest
~ chen.trust += 5
~ chen.comfort += 5
Margaret smiles, a small, kind smile. "The leap of faith is always taken in the dark, yes? You don't know until you land."
She sips her tea. "Well. You have landed here. With me. Let us see how it feels."

+ ["Thank you. What's on your mind today?"] -> Chen.Session1.Question

# ============================================================================
# LEARNING PATH 3: SELF-TAUGHT (Replaces BookResponse passages)
# ============================================================================

:: Chen.Session1.Learned_SelfTaught
~ chen.trust += 5
"I taught myself, mostly. Books, some online videos. I just... practiced until the cards started making sense."

"*Good*." She nods approvingly. "Book learning means you understand *structure*. Foundation. Not just... waving hands and feeling mystical energies."

She sips her tea.

"M. Thorne learned from a book too. They always said: 'Books are democratic. Anyone can learn if they do the work.'"

+ ["Is it bad that I don't have some mystical lineage?"] -> Chen.Session1.SelfTaught_Defensive
+ ["It felt right. The books were patient teachers."] -> Chen.Session1.SelfTaught_Simple

:: Chen.Session1.SelfTaught_Defensive
~ chen.trust += 5
~ chen.comfort += 5
~ reader.competence += 1
Margaret laughs - warm and genuine.

"*Aiya*, no! It's *better*." She sets down her mug.
"Natural 'psychics'—" she makes air quotes, "—they cannot teach. They just 'feel things.' 'I see visions.'
Very mysterious, very useless for teaching."

She leans forward slightly.
"But you? You learned the *language*. The grammar. The vocabulary of cards. This means you *understand* how it works. Not just *that* it works."

Relief floods through you.

+ ["That's... a huge relief to hear, actually."] -> Chen.Session1.Question

:: Chen.Session1.SelfTaught_Simple
~ chen.trust += 5
~ reader.competence += 1
"They are. They are always there when you need them. And they demand you do the work yourself."
She nods again. "Good. You have a solid foundation."

+ ["I'm glad you think so. What can I help you with?"] -> Chen.Session1.Question

# ============================================================================
# LEARNING PATH 4: MYSTIC
# ============================================================================

:: Chen.Session1.Learned_Mystic
~ chen.trust -= 5
"I... don't really know," you say honestly. "It sounds strange, but they just... started speaking to me one day. I don't fully understand it myself."

Margaret's expression tightens, just slightly. Her warmth recedes.

"Ah." Her voice is neutral. "A 'natural psychic.'"

She makes the air quotes, just as she did when she mentioned "mysterious mentor."

"M. Thorne was very wary of that," she says, her voice polite but cool. "They always said: 'People who just 'feel things' often cannot be taught. They are just feeling *themselves*, not the cards.'"

There's a tense silence. She's testing you.

+ ["That's why I started studying. The 'feeling' wasn't enough. I needed structure."] -> Chen.Session1.Mystic_Studied
+ ["I just trust what I feel. The structure and the books get in the way."] -> Chen.Session1.Mystic_Pure
+ ["I'm not sure what I'm doing. It's why I'm nervous."] -> Chen.Session1.Mystic_Honest

:: Chen.Session1.Mystic_Studied
~ chen.trust += 15 // Recovers the -5 and adds 10
~ reader.competence += 1
~ chen.comfort += 5
The tension in Margaret's shoulders eases. Her smile returns, small but genuine.
"Ah. So you are not *just* feeling. You are learning the *language*. That is different."
She nods. "Good. The intuition is the fire, but the book is the fireplace. You need both, or you burn the house down."

"You did the work. That is what matters."

+ ["I'm trying to. So, what can I help you with today?"] -> Chen.Session1.Question

:: Chen.Session1.Mystic_Pure
~ chen.trust -= 5 // Total of -10
~ session.atmosphere -= 1
Margaret's expression remains closed. She takes a slow sip of her tea.

"I see."

The warmth is gone. She is polite, but distant.

"Well. Let us hope your feelings are correct today."

+ [(Take a breath.) "What is your question?"] -> Chen.Session1.Question

:: Chen.Session1.Mystic_Honest
~ chen.trust += 5 // Recovers the -5
~ chen.comfort += 10
~ reader.empathy += 1
You look down at your hands. "I'm not pretending to be some... grand master. It's just... I feel this connection, but it's new, and I'm still figuring out what it means. It's why I was so nervous."

Margaret's face softens completely. The skepticism vanishes, replaced by kindness.

"Good. Honesty is better than false confidence. Nervousness means you care."

She pats your hand. "Is okay, dear. We will figure it out together. M. Thorne said 'willingness to learn' was the most important part."

+ ["Thank you. What can I help you with?"] -> Chen.Session1.Question

:: Chen.Session1.Question
Margaret is quiet for a moment, drinking her tea. You notice her hands - aged but steady, a jade bracelet on her left wrist catching the candlelight.

Then:

"I need help making a decision." She sets down her mug. "About my house."

You wait, letting her find the words.

"I've lived there forty years. Capitol Hill - when it was still affordable. Before tech people came." A wry smile. "My husband David and I, we bought it in 1983. Ninety thousand dollars."

She shakes her head slightly, still surprised by it.

"Now is worth... over one million. *Diu*." The Cantonese expletive slips out. "Sorry. But really. One million."

+ ["That's incredible."] -> Chen.Session1.HouseValue_Impressed
+ {reader.style == "practical"} ["Your children must be thinking about that."] -> Chen.Session1.HouseValue_Practical
+ [Stay quiet, let her continue] -> Chen.Session1.HouseValue_Silent

:: Chen.Session1.HouseValue_Impressed
"That's incredible. Forty years of Seattle changing."

"*Mm*." She looks wistful. "We saw the neighborhood transform. Filipino families, Vietnamese families, Japanese families - all in the 80s and 90s, making community. Then tech boom. Then..." She gestures vaguely. "Now is different."

+ [(Nod.) "So what's the decision?"] -> Chen.Session1.ChildrenPressure

:: Chen.Session1.HouseValue_Practical
# GATED to practical style
~ chen.trust += 5  // You saw the real issue immediately
~ reader.competence += 1
~ chen.discussed_guilt = True  // Flag: recognized the family pressure
"Your children must be thinking about that. A million dollars."

Margaret's expression shifts - something between resigned and pained.

"*Aiya*, you see it already." She sighs. "Yes. They think about it. They don't say directly, but I know."

"They say: 'Ma, you're too old for stairs. Move somewhere easier. We can help you find nice place.' But what they mean is..." She trails off.

"They're struggling too."

"Yes."

+ ["That's... a difficult position to be in."] -> Chen.Session1.ChildrenElaborate

:: Chen.Session1.HouseValue_Silent
You don't fill the silence. Just wait.

Margaret stares at her tea.

After a moment:

"My children want me to sell."

Her voice is quiet.

"They say: 'Ma, you're getting older. The stairs are too much. Move somewhere easier. Safer. We'll help you.' They're good children. They worry."

She looks up at you.

"But I love that house."

+ ["Tell me more."] -> Chen.Session1.LoveHouse

:: Chen.Session1.ChildrenPressure
~ chen.discussed_practical = True  // Flag: acknowledged her physical concerns
"My children - they worry. They say: 'Ma, you're getting older. The stairs are hard. What if you fall? Come live near us in Eastside. We'll take care of you.'"

She says "Eastside" like it's another country.

"But I'm sixty-eight, not ninety-eight. I'm tired, yes. House is work, yes. But I'm not *invalid*."

A pause.

"In Hong Kong, my mother lived alone until eighty-five. Nobody said 'too old.' But here, everything is: 'Senior living.' 'Assisted care.' 'Memory facility.' Like being old means being helpless."

+ ["You don't need to defend yourself to me."] -> Chen.Session1.Defend_Supportive
+ ["So you want to stay in the house."] -> Chen.Session1.Defend_Simple
+ ["But you are tired. Both things can be true."] -> Chen.Session1.Defend_Complex

~ reader.empathy += 1
"You don't need to defend yourself to me. You're allowed to want what you want."

Margaret's eyes soften. "*Mm*. Thank you."

She's quiet for a moment.

"I do want to stay. But I also want to stop being so *tired*."

+ ["The house is work."] -> Chen.Session1.Elaborate

:: Chen.Session1.Defend_Simple
"So you want to stay in the house."

"Is not that simple." She shakes her head. "Part of me wants to stay. Part of me wants someone else to deal with the gutters and the furnace and David's garden."

She looks at her hands.

"My daughter cried last time I fell. Small fall - just on the porch steps, icy morning. Nothing broken. But she *cried*."

+ ["Her crying... that adds to the pressure."] -> Chen.Session1.Elaborate

:: Chen.Session1.Defend_Complex
~ chen.trust += 10  // You named the contradiction
~ chen.comfort += 5
~ reader.competence += 1
~ reader.empathy += 1
"But you are tired," you say gently. "Both things can be true. You're not helpless AND you're tired."

Margaret stares at you.

Then: "*Wah*. Yes. This is exactly it."

"I'm not fragile. But I'm also not twenty-five. Both true. Nobody else says this. They say: pick one. Be independent OR be safe. Be strong OR be tired."

"But you're both."

"Yes."

+ ["So the house is a burden, but also..."] -> Chen.Session1.Elaborate

:: Chen.Session1.ChildrenElaborate
She looks at her hands - the jade bracelet, the age spots, the wedding ring she still wears.

"They're good children. Both doing well - good jobs, good families. But everything is so expensive now. They cannot afford houses like we could. Their children's colleges..."

Understanding settles in your chest.

"If you sell, they inherit while you're alive. It helps them."

"Yes." Almost a whisper. "And I *want* to help them. They're my children. But also..."

+ ["But also, it's your *home*."] -> Chen.Session1.LoveHouse

:: Chen.Session1.LoveHouse
"That house..." Her voice catches slightly. "Every room has David. His books in the study. His tools still in the garage. The garden he planted - roses, tomatoes, that stubborn apple tree that never makes good apples but he loved it anyway."

She wipes her eyes quickly, efficient.

"In Cantonese we say: 樹老根多，人老友多. Means: old tree has many roots. Old person has many friends. You understand?"

+ ["Your roots are in that house. In that neighborhood."] -> Chen.Session1.Roots_Understanding
+ {reader.style == "practical"} ["But roots can be replanted."] -> Chen.Session1.Roots_Replanting
+ {reader.style == "storyteller"} ["Tell me more about the neighborhood."] -> Chen.Session1.Roots_Storyteller

:: Chen.Session1.Roots_Understanding
~ chen.discussed_culture = True  // Flag: acknowledged her community/cultural roots
~ chen.comfort += 5
"Your roots are in that house. In that neighborhood."

"*Mm*." She nods emphatically. "Forty years I know these people. Filipino family next door - I watched their children grow up, now they're having children. Vietnamese grocery on the corner - Mr. Nguyen, he saves good *bok choy* for me every week. The temple is walking distance."

She looks at you directly.

"If I move to Eastside, to those... those clean apartment buildings with all white people, no community, just... quiet hallways and locked doors... I lose my roots."

+ ["It sounds like you'd be losing your whole world."] -> Chen.Session1.CoreConflict

:: Chen.Session1.Roots_Replanting
# GATED to practical style
~ chen.trust += 5  // Metaphor resonated
~ reader.competence += 1
"But roots can be replanted. That's what happens with old trees - they're moved carefully, given time to establish, and they grow again."

Margaret tilts her head, considering.

"Maybe. But I'm not sure I have energy to grow new roots at sixty-eight."

Then, softer: "Or maybe I'm scared to try."

+ ["It's a lot to consider."] -> Chen.Session1.CoreConflict

:: Chen.Session1.Roots_Storyteller
# GATED to storyteller style
~ chen.discussed_culture = True
~ chen.comfort += 10  // She opened up

"Tell me more about the neighborhood. About your roots there."

Margaret's face lightens - she *wants* to talk about this.

"*Aiya*, where do I start? The Filipino family next door - Luz and Ramon - I helped watch their children when they were working double shifts. Now their daughter Maya brings her baby to visit me."

She warms to the topic.

"Mr. Nguyen at the Vietnamese grocery - every week for twenty years he saves good *bok choy* for me. We don't talk much, but he *knows* me. The Buddhist temple on 15th - I'm not Buddhist, but I go sometimes. Sit in the garden. They know me there too."

"These are not just neighbors. These are *my people*. My community."

:: Chen.Session1.Elaborate
"But also-" Her voice strengthens. "The house is *work*. Garden maintenance. Gutter cleaning. Furnace makes strange noise. Winter comes, I worry about ice on steps. Worry about falling again, having my daughter *cry* again."

She looks at you.

"And the guilt. *Diu*, the guilt. If I stay: selfish, making children worry. If I sell: losing myself, but helping family."

She spreads her hands helplessly.

"American logic says: 'Be practical. Be safe. Move to easier place.' Chinese logic says: 'Honor your roots. Stay where you belong. Don't abandon your home.' Mother-logic says: 'Help your children. They struggle. You can help.'"

A long pause.

"So. That's why I'm here. What do the cards say when all the logic fails? When every choice feels wrong?"

This isn't "should I stay or should I go." This is: identity, family, culture, grief, exhaustion, love, guilt, fear, hope - all tangled together.
