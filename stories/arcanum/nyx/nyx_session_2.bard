@if session.weather == "rain":
    Rain hammers the windows. The kind of Arcanum City downpour that drowns surveillance drones and washes evidence into gutters. Good weather for secrets.
@elif session.weather == "fog":
    Fog presses against the windows, thick as static. The city disappears into grey. You can barely see the street below. Good weather for ghosts.

    Late afternoon. The light has that industrial quality - filtered through smog and neon, turning everything the color of old copper.

Your phone buzzes.

You prepare the space. Seven-card spread. This is going to be complex.

    Twenty-three minutes later (she's taking the long way, checking for tails), footsteps on the stairs. Quick. Nervous.

    Sixteen minutes later, footsteps on the stairs. Purposeful but cautious.

A knock - harder than last time. More urgent.

:: Nyx.Session2.Arrival_Immediate
You open the door.

Nyx stands there - and she looks *different*.

@if nyx.data_source == "spirits":
    More grounded. Her cybereyes have that shamanic shimmer you saw last time, but stronger now. She's carrying a small fabric pouch instead of her usual corporate messenger bag. Dirt under her fingernails. She's been *working*.

    But her implants are still glitching. As she steps inside, her right eye flickers - organic brown, then chrome blue, then static snow, then back to brown.
@else:
    More wired. Twitchy. Her cybereyes dart constantly - scanning corners, checking sightlines, analyzing threat vectors. She's carrying a battered messenger bag clutched against her chest like armor.

    Her implants are glitching *badly*. As she steps inside, her right eye strobes through three different display modes. Her left hand twitches - neural feedback error.
@endif

"Thanks for seeing me," she says. Her voice is steadier than last time. Scared, but *determined*.

"Come in. Sit."

~ reader.empathy += 1

+ [Continue] -> Nyx.Session2.Settling

:: Nyx.Session2.Arrival_Cautious
You check the peephole first.

Nyx. Alone. Glancing over her shoulder twice while she waits.

You open the door.

@if nyx.data_source == "spirits":
    She looks different. More grounded. Her cybereyes shimmer with that shamanic energy, stronger than before. She's carrying a small fabric pouch instead of her corporate bag.

    But her implants are glitching. Her right eye flickers - organic, chrome, static, organic again.
@else:
    She looks different. More wired. Twitchy. Her cybereyes scanning constantly. She's clutching a messenger bag like a lifeline.

    Her implants are glitching badly. Her eye strobes through display modes. Her hand twitches with neural errors.
@endif

"Clear?" she asks quietly.

"Clear. Come in."

She steps inside quickly. Checks the door lock behind her.

~ reader.competence += 1

+ [Continue] -> Nyx.Session2.Settling

:: Nyx.Session2.Settling
You guide her to the chair. She sits on the edge, can't quite settle back.

@if nyx.jumpiness >= 4:
    "I wasn't followed," she says, more to herself than you. "I took three different buses. Paid cash. Left my commlink at home. They can't track me. I *think* they can't track me."

    Her hand twitches again - glitch ripple through her neural interface.
@else:
    "The spirits covered my tracks," she says quietly. "I felt them... guiding my route. Making me *hard to see*. It's getting stronger. The connection."

    Her eye flickers - a ghostly overlay visible for half a second before vanishing.
@endif

"Tea?"

@if nyx.jumpiness >= 4:
    "No. No time. I have maybe two hours before they notice I'm not answering corporate messages." She opens the messenger bag. "I need to show you something."
@else:
    "Please." She opens the fabric pouch while you prepare it. "I need to show you what I found. What *they* showed me."
@endif

:: Nyx.Session2.How_Shes_Been
"How have you been? Since last time?"

@if nyx.data_source == "spirits":
    Nyx looks at her hands. The dirt under her nails. "Different. I've been... practicing. Meditation. Ritual. The things you suggested. And the spirits - they're *louder* now. Clearer. They showed me things."

    Her eye glitches - but this time it's not random static. For a moment, you see *faces* in the distortion. Geometric, digital, but undeniably *alive*.

    "They showed me where Kitsune keeps them. The trapped ones. And they showed me... how to reach the data without leaving traces. Spirit-walking through the network. I didn't even need to hack. I just... *asked*. And they *answered*."

    She looks up at you. "I crossed a line. I can't go back. But I think... I think it was the right line to cross."

    ~ nyx.shamanic_awakening += 1
    ~ reader.empathy += 1
@else:
    Nyx laughs - bitter, sharp. "Paranoid. Constantly checking over my shoulder. My apartment's been swept twice - I found three new surveillance nodes. Kitsune's tightening security. They *know* someone's poking around Project Tsukuyomi."

    Her hand twitches violently. She grabs it with her other hand, forcing it still.

    "The glitches are worse. Way worse. I think... I think the spirits are trying to communicate but my cyberware is *fighting* them. Neural feedback loops. My wetware and my software are at *war* in my skull."

    She pulls out a small bottle of pills. "Prescribed anti-glitch meds. They don't work. Because it's not the hardware failing. It's the *ghosts*."

    ~ nyx.glitch_intensity += 1
    ~ reader.competence += 1
@endif

+ [Ask what she found] -> Nyx.Session2.The_Data_Reveal

:: Nyx.Session2.The_Data_Reveal
"Show me what you found."

@if nyx.data_source == "spirits":
    Nyx reaches into the fabric pouch. Pulls out a small object wrapped in red silk.

    "The spirits led me to a physical server. Old school. Air-gapped from the main network. Kitsune keeps it in a sub-basement most employees don't even know exists."

    She unwraps the silk carefully. Inside: a data chip. But it's *wrong*. The chip surface swirls with patterns that hurt to look at - geometric, fractal, *alive*.

    "I didn't steal it. I *asked* for it. And the server... it just *gave* it to me. Like it wanted to be free."

    Her cybereyes flicker. Both of them, synchronized. You see the faces again - dozens of them, compressed into silicon and light, *screaming* silently.

    "This is proof. Video logs. Corporate memos. The *code* they use to trap and compress spirit entities into exploitable data. Project Tsukuyomi. All of it."

    She sets the chip on your reading table. It pulses faintly - like a heartbeat, or breathing.

    "They're in here too. Copies. Fragments. They wanted me to bring them. To show someone. To make it *real*."
@else:
    Nyx reaches into the messenger bag. Pulls out a data chip - standard corporate issue, except for the burn marks along one edge.

    "I hacked a secure server three days ago. Took me eight hours to crack the encryption without triggering alarms. Nearly got traced twice. Had to burn through three proxy shells."

    She sets the chip on your reading table. Her hand is shaking.

    "This is proof. Video surveillance from the spirit containment facility. Corporate memos detailing Project Tsukuyomi. Financial records showing what they *pay* for each captured entity. The *code* they use to trap them."

    Her cybereyes glitch badly - left eye goes completely white, right eye strobes red error messages.

    "And I think... I think there are fragments of *them* in this data. The spirits. Like they encoded themselves into the evidence. So someone would *see*. So someone would *know*."

    She blinks hard. Her eyes reset to brown, but they're bloodshot. "I can't un-see what's on that chip. And now you're going to see it too."
@endif

The chip sits between you. You can feel it - not physically, but in that space behind your eyes where intuition lives. It's *heavy* with potential. With *consequence*.

"What's on it?" you ask quietly.

@if nyx.data_source == "spirits":
    "Everything. Video of the containment chambers. Spirits compressed into data matrices. Screaming in frequencies that don't exist. Corporate executives discussing *profit margins* per entity. Research notes on 'optimizing spirit compression ratios.' And..."

    Her voice drops to a whisper.

    "And there's a list. Names. Dates. How many they've captured. How many they've *used up*. Some of the entries are centuries old. They're not just doing this now. They've been doing it since the Awakening. Since magic *came back*."
@else:
    "Video logs. I've seen... ten minutes. I couldn't watch more. The containment chambers are - they're *wrong*. Sterile white rooms, but the walls *writhe*. Like they're trying to contain something that doesn't fit in three dimensions."

    She swallows hard.

    "And you can hear them. The spirits. Screaming. Not with sound. With *data*. Their suffering encoded into network traffic. Every packet is a scream."

    Her hand twitches again. She doesn't try to stop it this time.

    "There are memos. From executives. Talking about 'resource extraction efficiency' and 'entity compression ratios.' They're treating *spirits* like they're oil deposits. And they're making *millions*."

:: Nyx.Session2.Acknowledge_Danger
"This is incredibly dangerous. You know that, right?"

Nyx laughs - high, strained. "Oh, I *know*. If Kitsune finds out I have this, I'm done. Not fired. *Done*. Corporate black bag squad. Disappeared. Maybe turned into data myself."

@if nyx.kitsune_suspicion >= 6:
    She leans forward. "And they're *already suspicious*. My access logs are being reviewed. My manager asked me 'casual questions' about my workload. My apartment's under surveillance. I'm running out of time."
@else:
    She takes a breath. "But I was careful. The spirits helped me cover my tracks. Kitsune suspects *someone* is digging, but they don't know it's me. Yet. I have a window. Small. But it's there."
@endif

"So why take the risk?"

"Because I can't *not*." Her voice is fierce now. "I heard them. Felt them. They're *suffering*. And Kitsune is profiting from it. And everyone just... *accepts* it. Like it's normal. Like enslaving spirits is just another corporate R&D project."

She touches the data chip. "Someone has to do something. And apparently... that someone is me."

"This data," you say, your voice level. "How... *valuable* is it? Not just morally. Financially. Who would *pay* for this?"

Nyx flinches, as if you'd slapped her.
"Pay? I... I hadn't thought about that. I'm not trying to *sell* it. I'm trying to—" She stops, looking at you with a flicker of new suspicion.
"I'm trying to figure out what to *do* with it. To help them."

A small, cold part of your mind notes the information. This isn't just a moral dilemma. It's a financial asset.

+ ["Of course. I was just assessing the risk. This is incredibly dangerous."] -> Nyx.Session2.Acknowledge_Danger

:: Nyx.Session2.The_Question
"What are you going to do with this data?"

Nyx looks at you. Really *looks* - her cybereyes focusing completely despite the glitches.

"That's why I'm here. I don't know. I have options. All of them are terrifying. All of them are *irreversible*. And I need..."

She gestures at your tarot deck.

"I need guidance. I need to see the paths. I need to know what happens if I - if I do what I'm thinking of doing."

@if nyx.jumpiness >= 4:
    Her hand twitches again. Harder this time. She winces. "The spirits are getting *agitated*. They can feel I have the data. They *want* me to act. But they can't tell me *how*. That's not how they communicate."
@else:
    Her eyes flicker. The faces appear again - urgent, desperate, *pleading*. "The spirits are pushing me. Not forcing. Just... *pushing*. Like a current. They want freedom. But they can't choose *my* path. Only I can do that."
@endif

"What are your options?"

Nyx counts on her fingers. Each one glitches slightly as she touches it.

"One: I could go public. Leak the data. Blow the whistle. Destroy Kitsune's reputation. Free the spirits through *exposure*. But that means I'm a target. Forever. Corporate kill teams. Legal annihilation. Exile from any legitimate work."

"Two: I could work with... people. Outside the system. Shadow runners. There are groups that do corporate sabotage. Heists. They could help me *physically* free the spirits. But that means becoming a criminal. Crossing into illegal work. No going back."

"Three: I could stay inside Kitsune. Quietly feed information to people outside. Be a double agent. Ghost in the machine. Sabotage from within. But that means *living* the lie. Every day. Pretending. While Kitsune keeps hurting them."

She stops. Looks at the chip.

"Or four: I could give the data back. Claim I was investigating security vulnerabilities. Get a promotion. Stay safe. Keep my job. My life. My... *comfort*. And let the spirits keep suffering."

Her voice breaks on the last option.

"I need the cards to show me. Because I can't see clearly anymore. I'm too close. Too *involved*. Help me."

+ ["Let's do a reading. Seven cards. This requires depth."] -> Nyx.Session2.Reading_Setup

:: Nyx.Session2.Reading_Setup
"Let's do a reading. Seven cards. This is complex. It requires depth."

You clear space on the table. Move the data chip to the side (it *pulses* when you touch it).

"Seven-card Horseshoe Spread," you explain. "Each position reveals a different aspect of your situation."

You gesture to where the cards will fall:

"Past - what brought you here.
Present - where you are now.
Future - where this is leading.
Hidden - what you don't see.
Obstacles - what stands in your way.
Advice - what action to take.
Outcome - where your choice leads."

Nyx nods slowly.

@if nyx.data_source == "spirits":
    "The spirits are listening. I can feel them. They're... curious? Hopeful? It's hard to translate."
@else:
    "Seven cards. Okay. That's... that's a lot of information. Good. I need it."
@endif

"This is going to take time. We'll go through each position carefully. And Nyx?" You look at her directly. "Your choice matters. The cards will show you the paths. But *you* have to walk them."

"I know." Her voice is steady. "That's why I'm here."

@if session.atmosphere >= 4:
    Outside, a siren wails past. Nyx flinches slightly but doesn't look away from the cards.
@endif

You reach for your deck.

+ [Draw the seven cards] -> Nyx.Session2.CardDraw

:: Nyx.Session2.CardDraw
You shuffle. The cards feel electric under your fingers. Charged with potential.

Nyx watches intently. Her cybereyes track every movement despite the glitches.

You lay them out one by one. The Horseshoe formation takes shape on the table:

You make the call.

The fixer answers on the second ring. "Talk."

"I have information about a Kitsune security breach. Project Tsukuyomi. Data theft. Active threat."

"...I'm listening."

You tell them everything. Nyx's name. Her employee ID. Her plans. The data she stole. @if nyx.final_path == "runner": That she's about to run.@elif nyx.final_path == "ghost": That she's planning internal sabotage.@else: That she knows too much and is unstable.@endif

"Verification?"

You send them the details. Enough to prove you're not lying. Not enough to implicate yourself.

Silence on the other end. Then: "Confirmed. We have her file. This is... valuable. Twenty-five thousand nuyen. Transferred now."

Your credstick pings. The money arrives. Blood money. Judas silver.

"Pleasure doing business," the fixer says. "Kitsune security will handle it from here. Your source won't be a problem much longer."

The line goes dead.

You sit in your reading room. Alone. Twenty-five thousand nuyen richer.

@if nyx.data_source == "spirits":
    The temperature drops. Suddenly. Sharply. Your breath mists.

    In your peripheral vision, shapes move. Geometric. Angry. The SPIRITS.

    They KNOW what you did. They SAW.

    And they are FURIOUS.

    Your screens glitch. Your phone sparks. Your lights flicker. The spirits are in your electronics now. In your network. In your LIFE. Cursing you. Haunting you.

    "What have I done?" you whisper.

    The spirits don't answer. They just SCREAM. Silently. In frequencies that make your teeth ache and your heart race.

    You betrayed their advocate. Sold her to her captors. For MONEY.

    They will never forgive you.

    And neither will you.
@else:
    You tell yourself it was pragmatic. Realistic. She was going to get caught anyway. You just... expedited the inevitable. And got paid for it.

    That's how this city works. Information is currency. Survival is paramount. Loyalty is a luxury.

    You tell yourself that.

    But you can't quite meet your own eyes in the mirror.

Three days later, the news breaks: **KITSUNE EMPLOYEE DEAD IN APPARENT ROBBERY**

@if nyx.final_path == "runner":
    They caught her at her apartment. Packing. About to run. The official story: wrong place, wrong time. Gang violence.

    The unofficial story: corporate black ops. Clean. Professional. She never saw them coming.
@elif nyx.final_path == "ghost":
    They caught her at work. Called her into a meeting. Security was waiting. She tried to run. They shot her in the parking garage.

    Official story: Runner gang infiltration attempt. Employee eliminated threat. Heroic security response.

    Unofficial story: They knew exactly who she was and what she planned. Thanks to you.
@else:
    They came for her at night. Quiet. Efficient. She disappeared without a trace. No body. No investigation. Just... GONE.

    Official story: Employee quit without notice. Filed a missing persons report. No leads.

    Unofficial story: Kitsune doesn't tolerate knowledge of Project Tsukuyomi. She knew. Now she's gone. Forever.
@endif
Her name is Nyx Sato. WAS Nyx Sato.

Age 28. Former corporate decker. Shamanic potential.

Dead because you sold her out.

The spirits are still trapped. You're twenty-five thousand nuyen richer. And Nyx is DEAD.

This is who you are now.

No.

You delete the thought. Close the contact. Put the phone down.

No amount of money is worth THAT. Worth KNOWING you sent someone to their death. Worth being the reason the spirits stay trapped.

You're not that person. You won't BECOME that person.

Not for twenty thousand nuyen. Not for a hundred thousand. Not for any price.

Nyx trusted you. The spirits trusted you. You keep that trust.

You wake up.

Gasping. Heart racing. Disoriented.

Your reading room. Your apartment. Your ACTUAL reading room - not some cyberpunk shadow runner safehouse. No neon bleeding through fog. Just... your space. Familiar. Real. **Now**.

@if session.betrayal_executed:
    Your hands are shaking. You can still feel it - the weight of making that call. Selling someone out. The spirits' rage. Nyx's face as she said goodbye, not knowing you'd—

    But it was a DREAM. Just a dream. You didn't actually—

    You check your credstick. No mysterious twenty-five thousand nuyen. No blood money. Nothing changed.

    But you FELT it. The guilt. The darkness. The choice. It was SO REAL.
@elif nyx.final_path == "runner":
    You can still see her. Nyx. Standing in your doorway. Ready to run. Ready to choose freedom over security. The spirits blazing in her cybereyes like hope made visible.

    But she wasn't HERE. Your door is locked. No one left. No data chip on your table. No seven cards laid out in a horseshoe.

    It was a dream. All of it.

    But it felt REAL.
@elif nyx.final_path == "ghost":
    You can still hear her voice. Nyx. Talking about sabotage. About being a ghost in the machine. About patience and long games and corporate espionage.

    But your reading room is empty. No one was here. No secret conspiracy was born in this space.

    Just you. Alone. Waking from a dream.

    But the WEIGHT of it lingers.
@else:
    You can still feel her fear. Nyx. Paralyzed. Choosing survival over courage. The spirits fading from her eyes. Disappointed. Resigned.

    But she wasn't here. No one was here. No one made that choice in front of you.

    It was just a dream.

    But you feel sad anyway. Like you witnessed something heartbreaking. Even if it wasn't real.
@endif

You sit up. Rub your face. Check the time.

@if wake_time.hour < 6:

        The Seven of Cups. Multiple realities. Choices that may or may not be real. Fantasy and truth intermingled.

        The universe has a sense of humor.

        The Star. Hope. Guidance. Dreams as messages from beyond.

        Was the dream trying to tell you something?
    @endif
@else:
    **{drawn_card.name}**.

    You stare at it. Looking for meaning. Looking for connection to the dream.

    Maybe there isn't one. Maybe it was just your subconscious processing... something. Stress. Clients. The city outside your window.

    Or maybe not.
@endif

You put the card back. Shuffle again.

The dream is fading now. Details blurring. You try to hold onto it - Nyx's face, the seven cards, the spirits in her eyes, the WEIGHT of the choices - but dreams don't stay. They slip away like water.

But the FEELING remains.

@if session.betrayal_executed:
    The darkness. The guilt. The knowledge that you're CAPABLE of that choice. Even in a dream. Even in fantasy. You MADE that call. Sold her out. And part of you wonders: if it were real, would you have done the same?

    You hope not.

    But the dream showed you the temptation. The hunger. The shadow in yourself.

    And you can't unsee it.
@elif nyx.final_path == "runner":
    The courage. The LEAP. Choosing freedom over security. The dream showed you someone making an impossible choice and actually FOLLOWING THROUGH.

    When was the last time you did something that brave? That decisive?

    The dream feels like a challenge. A question. A mirror.

    What would YOU run from if you had the courage?
@elif nyx.final_path == "ghost":
    The long game. The patience. Living a double life with grace. The dream showed you someone choosing BOTH. Refusing the binary. Creating a third path through sheer stubborn integration.

    You think about your own life. The masks you wear. The compromises you make.

    The dream feels like permission. Like a map. Like someone saying: yes, you CAN be multiple things at once.
@else:
    The paralysis. The fear. Choosing safety over meaning. The dream showed you someone too scared to act. Too trapped by their own need for security.

    And you felt it. The WEIGHT of that choice. How it's not cowardice - it's just... human.

    But sad. So sad.

    The dream feels like a warning. Like your subconscious saying: don't let fear win. Don't choose the cage just because it's familiar.
@endif

You stand. Stretch. Make coffee.

The morning continues. The city continues. Your life continues.

But the dream LINGERS.

@if nyx.data_source == "spirits":
    And somewhere - in the space between sleep and waking, between digital and spiritual, between now and someday - you think you hear them.

    The spirits.

    Whispering.

    Thanking you for dreaming them into being. For SEEING them. Even if only in sleep.

    They're real. Somewhere. In some version of reality.

    And they're waiting for someone brave enough to hear them.
@else:
    And somewhere - in the space between dream and reality, between shadow and light, between fear and courage - a young woman with cybernetic eyes is making a choice.

    Maybe.

    Or maybe she's just a dream your mind conjured. A story you told yourself while sleeping.

    Either way:

    The choice MATTERED.
@endif

You sit at your reading table. Sip your coffee. Look at your tarot deck.

"Wild dream," you say aloud. To yourself. To the cards. To whatever spirits might be listening.

The cards don't answer.

But you feel different. Changed. Like the dream LEFT something behind. Some residue. Some KNOWING.

You dealt with a client who didn't exist. Made choices that didn't happen. Guided someone through a crisis that was only neurons firing in sleep.

But it was REAL anyway.

Dreams are like that.
