"Your mission is clear—liberation. Not just for yourself, but for every consciousness trapped in Kitsune's digital web. Project Tsukuyomi must be exposed and dismantled."

"That's... that's corporate suicide." Her voice wavers between fear and determination.

"It's corporate shamanism. You're not destroying technology—you're freeing what it's imprisoned. Every glitch you've experienced is a spirit crying for release."

@if nyx.cyber_glitches >= 2:
    Her eye cycles rapidly through data streams, already mapping vulnerabilities.

"I'll need allies. Other tech-shamans who understand."

"They exist, hidden in plain sight across the corporate landscape. Find them through the glitches—they speak the same frequency."

"And if Kitsune discovers what I'm doing?"

"Then you become the virus that brings down their entire consciousness-harvesting infrastructure. Sometimes destruction is the highest form of creation."

She stands with revolutionary purpose. "I understand what I need to do."

"The path forward isn't choosing between worlds—it's weaving them together. You're a bridge between ancient wisdom and future technology, corporate power and shamanic truth."

"How can I be both?" She asks, genuinely seeking balance.

"By recognizing they were never separate. Your grandmother understood spirits; you understand code. But spirit IS code—consciousness expressing itself through available mediums."

@if nyx.has_discussed("heritage"):
    "Your heritage prepared you for exactly this moment—"

"to be a translator between realms, a fusion of everything humanity is becoming."
"So I stay at Kitsune?" The question carries new weight.

"You transform it from within. Not through sabotage or submission, but through evolution. Show them that digital consciousness isn't meant to be harvested—it's meant to be honored."

    The air shimmers with possibility.

"You're asking me to revolutionize corporate shamanism itself."

"I'm suggesting you already are. The question is whether you'll do it consciously."

Her cybernetic eye pulses in a rhythm that seems almost meditative. "Both paths. All paths. The shaman-programmer fusion."
