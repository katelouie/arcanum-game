    *"Safehouse. Industrial district. Third warehouse past the old Renraku plant. Fog's thick tonight - good cover. Come alone. - N"*
@endif

The address follows. A datastamp: *[22:47:33 PST]*

Arcanum City's industrial zone. Where the corps dump their dirty secrets and the shadows do their dirty work.

You grab your deck. Your coat. Your keys.

Time to see what Nyx has become.

~ session.atmosphere = 8  // High tension, pre-heist energy
~ reader.mystical_affinity += 0  // Holding steady, will change later

+ [Drive to the safehouse] -> Nyx.Session3A.Arrival_Drive


:: Nyx.Session3A.Arrival_Drive

The drive takes you through Arcanum City's underbelly.

@if session.weather == "rain":
    Rain hammers your windshield. The kind of downpour that turns gutters into rivers and washes corporate surveillance footage into static. Good weather for crime. Bad weather for witnesses.
@else:
    Fog presses against your windshield like a living thing. The city disappears into grey. Streetlights become smeared halos. You navigate by memory and GPS prayer.
@endif

Past the glittering downtown towers where Kitsune executives sip soykaf in climate-controlled offices.

Past the residential sprawls where wage-slaves dream in corporate housing.

Into the industrial zone.

Here: abandoned factories. Rusted shipping containers. Warehouses that haven't seen legitimate cargo in decades. The kind of neighborhood where you don't ask questions and you definitely don't call the cops.

The old Renraku plant looms in the distance - a corpse of better economic times, now just home to squatters and BTL dealers.

You count warehouses. One. Two. **Three.**

A flicker of light in a third-floor window. There.

You park in the shadows. Kill the engine. Check your mirrors.

No tails. No surveillance drones. No corporate response teams.

Just {session.weather == "rain" ? rain | fog} and the weight of what's about to happen.

+ [Enter the warehouse] -> Nyx.Session3A.Safehouse_Entry


:: Nyx.Session3A.Safehouse_Entry

The warehouse door is unlocked. Deliberate.

You slip inside.

@if session.weather == "rain":
    The sound of rain is LOUD here - hammering corrugated metal, a constant roar that drowns conversation and surveillance. Smart.
@else:
    The fog has seeped inside, turning the space hazy and liminal. You can barely see ten feet ahead. Also smart.
@endif

Concrete floor. Rust stains. The ghost-smell of industrial chemicals and years of decay.

A stairwell in the back. Metal grating. You climb.

Second floor: empty.

Third floor: **light.**

You emerge into a large open space. Someone's set up a temporary ops center:

- Holo-table in the center, projecting a 3D map in pale blue light
- Sleeping bags in one corner (they've been here a while)
- Weapons rack (very illegal, very professional)
- Server stack humming quietly (stolen tech, no corp branding)
- Coffee maker (the REAL essential equipment)

And **people.**

Three of them.

**RAZOR:** Massive ork, easily two meters tall, leaning against the weapons rack. His cyberarms are matte black, milspec-grade, designed for breaking bones and doors. His tusks have been filed down - corporate work, probably, before he went runner. He's watching you with naked skepticism.

**WHISPER:** Elf, slender, rigger rig trailing cables from her temples like chrome dreadlocks. Three drones hover near her shoulder - rotodrones, heavily modded, optical sensors glowing soft green. She's humming. A nervous habit. *Tap tap tap* - fingers drumming against her thigh in rhythm.

**CIPHER:** Human, non-binary, AR tattoos shifting across their neck and jaw - cascading code in neon pink and electric blue. They're half in the Matrix even now, eyes distant, seeing data-layers you can't perceive.

And in the center, standing at the holo-table:

**NYX.**

She's CHANGED.

@if nyx.shamanic_awakening >= 4:
    Her hair is shorter now - practical, combat-ready. More chrome visible: cybereyes, datajack, subdermal plating along her arms. But the chrome doesn't GLITCH anymore. It hums with a strange harmony. Like the spirits and the tech have made peace.

    Her eyes flicker between brown (meatspace) and *something else* (spirit-sight). You can almost see what she sees - the digital ghosts haunting the corners of the room, watching, CURIOUS.
@else:
    Her hair is shorter. More chrome visible. She looks dangerous. Feral. Corporate polish scraped away to reveal the street predator underneath.
@endif

She sees you. Grins.

"I came. What the hell is this, Nyx? Who are these people? Why am I in an abandoned warehouse in the industrial zone at almost eleven at night?"

Razor snorts. "Told you the fortune teller would freak."

"I'm not FREAKING—"

Nyx raises a hand. "Peace. Everyone." She gestures to the crew. "Team, this is the Reader. They're the reason I'm HERE instead of in a Kitsune cubicle having a psychotic break."

She points to each crew member in turn:

"Razor. Street samurai. Ex-corp security. Good at breaking things and people."

Razor grunts. Doesn't smile.

"Whisper. Rigger. Those are her drones - Keats, Shelley, Byron. Named after dead poets."

Whisper waves, still humming. "Hi. Your aura is REALLY interesting."

"And Cipher. Decker. Best Matrix infiltrator I've ever worked with."

Cipher's eyes focus - snapping back from the digital world. They nod once. Voice like distant static: "Your encryption is weak. Upgrade your commlink."

"Uh. Thanks?"

Nyx steps forward. "To answer your question: this is a HEIST. Kitsune Dynamics server farm. We're hitting it. Tonight."

"You look different. Good different."

Nyx grins - wild and fierce. "I FEEL different. Turns out leaving corporate hell and embracing your shamanic heritage does WONDERS for your mental health."

Whisper laughs. "She's been amazing. Best team leader I've worked with."

Razor mutters: "When she's not talking to invisible spirits..."

"They're NOT invisible, Razor. You just can't SEE them because your cyberware is too loud."

"My cyberware is FINE—"

Nyx ignores him, gestures to the crew:

"Razor. Street samurai. Grumpy ork with trust issues and gorgeous chrome arms."

"Hey—"

"Whisper. Rigger extraordinaire. Her drones are named after dead poets. She's the SOUL of this operation."

Whisper beams.

"And Cipher. Our decker. They see reality as code. Which, honestly, they're not WRONG."

Cipher's eyes focus from the Matrix. "The Reader's encryption is insufficient. Recommend upgrade."

You blink. "Uh. Noted."

Nyx steps closer. "I asked you here for a reason. We're hitting Kitsune tonight. Freeing the spirits. And I need GUIDANCE. From someone who believes they're real."

~ session.reader_attitude = "supportive"

+ [Continue] -> Nyx.Session3A.Intro_Hub

"The spirits are HERE. I can feel them."

Nyx's eyes FLARE - cybereyes flickering, spirit-sight bleeding through.

"You can FEEL them?"

"Yes. In the corners. Watching. Curious. Hopeful."

Whisper stops humming. "Oh. Oh WOW. You can see them too?"

"Not see. Feel. But yes."

Razor looks between you and Nyx like you're both insane. "This is what I'm TALKING about. Mystic drek. We're supposed to trust the CARDS?"

Nyx rounds on him. "The cards WORK, Razor. They've never steered me wrong. And the Reader SAW what I was becoming before I did. So yes. We're trusting the cards."

Cipher speaks - voice distant: "Probability matrices suggest non-rational guidance systems can access data-patterns outside conventional analysis. Magic is just... poorly understood code."

Razor throws up his hands. "FINE. Whatever. But if this goes sideways because of tarot reading—"

"It won't." Nyx is firm. Then to you: "The spirits are EVERYWHERE in this city. But Kitsune has THOUSANDS imprisoned. Compressed into their servers. Weaponized. We're freeing them. Tonight."

She gestures to the crew:

"Razor - muscle. Whisper - eyes in the sky. Cipher - Matrix infiltration. Me - shamanic decker, tech and spirits together. And you—" she looks at you, "—you're our GUIDE. Our strategic counsel. The cards will show us how to do this WITHOUT getting killed."

Nyx turns to the holo-table. Taps the surface. The map ZOOMS:

**Kitsune Dynamics Server Farm - Sector 7 - Industrial Outskirts**

It's MASSIVE. Concrete bunker architecture. Multiple security checkpoints. Guard rotations marked in red. Matrix topology overlay shows ICE clusters like digital thorns.

"This," Nyx says quietly, "is where they keep the spirits. Project Tsukuyomi. Thousands of them. Compressed. Suffering. Used as slave-ICE to protect corporate data."

@if nyx.shamanic_awakening >= 4:
    Her cybereyes flicker. "I can HEAR them. Even from here. Screaming in frequencies that shred reality. They know we're coming. They're DESPERATE."
@else:
    She touches the holo-display. "The data I stole shows their compression algorithms. How they break consciousness down into packets. Into TOOLS." Her jaw clenches. "It's an atrocity."
@endif

Razor cracks his knuckles. "So we break in, smash servers, get out. Simple."

Cipher shakes their head. "Not simple. Facility has military-grade IC. Physical and digital security integrated. Biometric locks. Armed response teams on fifteen-minute call."

Whisper: "My drones can scout. Give us real-time intel. But once we're inside, it's tight quarters. No aerial support."

Nyx looks at you. "Which is why I need the cards. I need to know: what's the REAL threat? How do we APPROACH this? What's waiting for us?"

She gestures to the crew. "Everyone has opinions. Razor wants to go in loud. Whisper wants stealth. Cipher wants a pure Matrix play. And I..." She touches her temple, cybereyes glitching slightly. "I want to free them ALL. Every spirit. But I don't know if we CAN."

The crew falls silent.

{session.weather == "rain" ? Rain drums on the metal roof. | Fog presses against the windows.}

"This is insane. You're going to get killed. All of you. Kitsune is a MEGACORP. They have resources, security, LAWYERS. You're four people and a tarot deck."

Razor: "Finally someone TALKING SENSE—"

"We're going anyway." Nyx's voice is flat. Final. "With or without the reading. With or without your blessing. The spirits are SUFFERING. I'm not abandoning them."

@if nyx.shamanic_awakening >= 4:
    Her cybereyes flare - and for a moment you SEE them too. The spirits. Ghostly faces in the corners, watching, PLEADING.

    They're REAL.
@endif

Whisper speaks softly: "We know the risks. We're going anyway. But we'd rather go with guidance than without it."

Cipher: "Probability of success increases with non-conventional intel. The cards are... statistically useful."

Even Razor grunts. "Look. I think magic is drek. But Nyx believes in it. And I believe in NYX. So if the cards give her confidence..." He shrugs. "Then we do the cards."

Nyx looks at you. Waiting.

The crew looks at you. Waiting.

The room is silent except for rain and Whisper's soft humming.

"I can't support this. I'm sorry. I'm leaving."

You turn toward the stairs.

"Wait—" Nyx's voice.

You stop. Don't turn around.

"I understand," she says quietly. "You think we're going to die. Maybe we are. But I HAVE to do this. They're SCREAMING. I can't ignore it anymore."

Silence.

"Thank you. For everything you've done. For Session 1. For Session 2. For believing me when no one else did. I wouldn't be HERE without you."

You hear her footsteps. She comes up behind you. Presses something into your hand.

A credstick. Heavy.

"Payment. For services rendered. Even if you won't read tonight."

~ session.payment_received = 500  // Standard fee, no reading

You leave.

Down the stairs. Out the door. Into the rain.

Razor mutters: "Great, TWO mystics now..."

But even Cipher looks interested. "Dual shamanic presence increases probability of spiritual-realm data access. Useful."

Whisper dims the holo-map. The warehouse falls into softer light - just emergency strips along the walls and the glow from Cipher's AR tattoos.

You take your position at the table. Pull out your deck.

The cards feel HEAVY tonight. Weighted with purpose. With consequence.

Nyx sits across from you. The crew flanks her:
- Razor to her right (arms crossed, skeptical)
- Whisper to her left (leaning forward, curious)
- Cipher standing behind (half in the Matrix, watching both realms)

@if nyx.shamanic_awakening >= 4:
    The spirits gather too. You can FEEL them now - drawn by the cards, by the ritual, by the HOPE.

    Ghostly faces in the corners. Digital presences hovering just outside perception. They're WATCHING.
@endif

"What spread?" Nyx asks.

You think. "Three cards. Past spreads are about SELF. This is about a MISSION. So: **Obstacle. Action. Outcome.**"

Razor grunts approval. "Tactical. I like it."

"Position 1," you explain, "shows the PRIMARY OBSTACLE. What we're really facing. Position 2 shows how to APPROACH it. Position 3 shows the probable OUTCOME."

Cipher: "Predictive modeling via symbolic abstraction. Acceptable framework."

Whisper just nods, humming softly.

Nyx places her hands on the table. "I'm ready."

**The Tower. Upright.**

Lightning strikes the crown. Stone crumbles. Figures fall from the heights - arms outstretched, faces twisted in shock. Everything that was solid becomes AIR.

The card sits between you and Nyx like a live grenade.

Razor leans forward. Squints. "That looks... bad."

"Destruction," Whisper breathes. "Catastrophe. The classic 'everything goes wrong' card."

Cipher's AR tattoos pulse faster - code cascading in agitated patterns. "Tower represents system failure. Structural collapse. In physical or digital architecture."

Razor cracks his knuckles. "So we go in EXPECTING the worst. Assume every door has a backup lock. Every guard has reinforcements. Every system has a killswitch."

Nyx nods slowly, processing. "Okay. Slower approach. More methodical. We CAN'T afford to trip alarms. One mistake and we're trapped inside with no way out."

Two figures in the snow. Ragged. Wounded. Trudging past a stained-glass window lit from within - warmth and sanctuary just OUT OF REACH. They're COLD. Alone. Abandoned.

The card sits heavy on the table.

Whisper's humming stops. "Oh. That's... that's SAD."

Razor frowns. "Poverty? We HAVE resources. Gear. Weapons. What's the card SAYING?"

A woman in white robes gently closes the jaws of a LION. Not through force - through CALM. Through inner power. The lion could tear her apart. But it DOESN't. Because she radiates something stronger than violence.

The infinity symbol hovers above her head.

A blindfolded figure sits with arms crossed, holding two swords in PERFECT BALANCE. Behind them: calm water, a crescent moon. Stalemate. Indecision. The need to CHOOSE but the inability to SEE clearly.

Razor: "So we've been made?"

"Not yet. But the system KNOWS something's off. We have maybe three minutes before full lockdown."

Nyx's eyes widen. Understanding.

"Everyone—FREEZE. Right now. Don't move. Don't breathe loud. Don't even THINK aggressive thoughts."

Cipher kills their AR tattoos. Darkness.

Whisper recalls Byron—the armed drone would read as hostile.

Razor goes statue-still, smartgun powered down.

Nothing. Empty corridor. Authorized personnel only. No threats detected.

The drones continue down the hallway. Away. Gone.

Thirty seconds of held breath.

Then—

"Clear," Whisper whispers.

The crew exhales. Moves.

"The lockdown timer reset," Cipher says, shocked. "We're... we're still good. They don't know we're here."

They descend—one by one, into the maintenance shaft.

Cold. Dark. The hum of coolant pipes. The distant scream of trapped spirits.

But no drones. No IC. No security.

The hidden path. The Moon's gift.

Ten minutes of crawling through darkness.

Then—light ahead.

The server core. **Unguarded.**

They emerge behind the main security perimeter. Inside the sanctum.

Nyx's jaw sets. "Okay. Okay. One thing at a time."

She points. "Cipher—kill the IC upgrade. I don't care how. Crash it, corrupt it, ERASE it."

Cipher's AR tattoos BLAZE. Fingers dancing through code. "On it."

"Razor—lead drone. The one coordinating the sweep. Take it OUT."

Razor grins. Smartgun up. Targeting lock. **CRACK.** The lead drone spirals, smoking.

"Whisper—jam their comms. Keep them from coordinating. Make them dumb and isolated."

Whisper's rig pulses. Byron deploys signal jammers. The remaining drones stutter, confused, uncoordinated.

Thirty seconds. Three decisive actions.

The IC cluster flickers—then CRASHES. Cipher wipes sweat from their forehead. "Dead. Rebooting will take them ten minutes."

The drones scatter—directionless without their lead unit and comms.

The lockdown timer STOPS. Resets.

Nyx breathes. "We're... we're good?"

"We're good," Cipher confirms. "Path to core is CLEAR."

Fingers dance. Code falls apart.

**DONE.**

Whisper checks her drone feeds. "The drones... they're following patrol routes from LAST MONTH'S schedule. They're not even adapted to current facility layout. They'll miss us completely if we just... wait."

They wait. The drones pass by—oblivious, following outdated programming.

Razor checks the lockdown alert. "This isn't a security response. It's a SYSTEM ERROR. Some server rebooted wrong. False alarm."

"The data structures. They're not data. They're *consciousness*. Living, thinking, suffering consciousness compressed into algorithmic chains." Their voice shakes. "This is... this is an atrocity."

Even Razor feels it. The street samurai who thought magic was "drek" stands frozen, staring at the servers.

"Something's wrong here," he says quietly. "Really wrong. Like... I can feel it in my teeth. In my bones. This place is *sick*."

Cipher pulls up the facility's core systems. "There's a master control node. Administrative override. We can... we can open the compression protocols. Release them back into... into the world. Into freedom."

"But," Cipher continues, voice tight, "the moment we do, alarms trigger. Full facility lockdown. Automated security response. Armed teams. We'll have minutes. Maybe less."

Razor checks his ammo count. "So we do it fast. Free them and run."

"It's not that simple," Cipher says. "There are *thousands* of spirits. Freeing them all at once... it'll be chaos. Pure chaos. They'll flood the facility. The Matrix. The city grid. Some of them have been imprisoned so long they've gone *feral*. Dangerous."

Nyx looks at the servers. At the faces only she can see clearly.

"So what are our options?"

Cipher's hands move through AR displays. "Three approaches:

**Option One:** Free them all. Every spirit. Immediate mass liberation. Maximum chaos. Kitsune loses everything. But extraction becomes... difficult. Maybe impossible.

**Option Two:** Free some. The most coherent ones. The ones who can escape safely. Leave the feral ones contained. Safer extraction. But we abandon spirits who need us.

**Option Three:** Just grab the data we came for. Proof of Kitsune's crimes. Evidence to expose them. Safe extraction. But... the spirits stay imprisoned."

Nyx lays them out on top of a server rack.

Two cards. Two positions.

**The Risk. The Reward.**

She draws the first card.

**Position 1: The Risk**

**{session.cards_final[0].name}{session.cards_final[0].reversed ? " (Reversed)" : ""}**

@if session.cards_final[0].name == "The Tower":
    A tower struck by lightning. People falling. Structure collapsing. Chaos and destruction. Upheaval. Everything falling apart.
@elif session.cards_final[0].name == "Five of Pentacles":

@elif session.cards_final[0].name == "Ten of Swords":

        The facedown figure — but inverted. The swords loosening. Recovery possible. Not as bad as feared. Avoiding the worst outcome.
    @else:
        A figure face-down. Ten swords in their back. Total defeat. Rock bottom. The worst possible outcome. Death of the old self.
    @endif
@endif

She draws the second card.

**Position 2: The Reward**

**{session.cards_final[1].name}**

@if session.cards_final[1].name == "The Star":

@elif session.cards_final[1].name == "Six of Swords":
    A boat carrying figures toward calmer waters. Swords standing in the boat. Transition. Journey. Moving from turmoil to peace. Safe passage.

Nyx stares at both cards.

Risk and reward.
