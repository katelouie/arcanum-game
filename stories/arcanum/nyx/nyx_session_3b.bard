The address follows. Timestamp: **[22:17 PST]**

Two hours until the heist.

You grab your deck. Your coat. Your keys.

+ [Drive to her apartment] -> Nyx.Session3B.Drive


:: Nyx.Session3B.Drive

The drive takes you through Seattle's layers.

@if session.weather == "rain":
    Rain hammers your windshield. Heavy drops that sound like drums. The kind of downpour that drowns surveillance and washes away evidence. Perfect weather for shadow work.
@else:
    Fog presses against your windshield like living cotton. The city disappears into grey. You navigate by GPS and prayer, streetlights becoming smeared halos in the mist.
@endif

Past the glittering downtown core—Kitsune Dynamics' tower visible even from here, a spear of glass and steel piercing the clouds. Corporate beacon. Digital fortress. Tonight's target.

Past the corporate housing sprawls where salary workers dream in climate-controlled boxes.

Into Redmond's edge. The transitional zone. Not quite Barrens (where the desperate and dangerous live). Not quite sprawl (where the middle class pretends things are fine).

This is where corpo employees live when they're not quite successful enough for downtown but too proud for the Barrens. The in-between people. The strivers. The ones with *just* enough to lose.

**Azure Heights.** The sign is backlit, half the letters burned out: "Az re  eig ts."

Twenty-three stories of grey concrete pretending to be aspirational. The building has security cameras (broken) and a lobby door lock (bypassed months ago). The kind of place where people mind their own business because everyone has something to hide.

You park in the shadow of a broken streetlight. Check your mirrors.

No tails. No surveillance drones. No corporate response teams.

Just {session.weather == "rain" ? rain : fog} and the weight of what's about to happen.

+ [Enter the building] -> Nyx.Session3B.Building_Entry


:: Nyx.Session3B.Building_Entry

The lobby smells like old carpet and broken dreams.

Fluorescent lights flicker. Elevator is broken (of course). Stairwell door hangs half-open.

You climb. Twenty-three floors. Your calves burn by floor twelve. You keep going.

The stairwell echoes with your footsteps. Graffiti on the walls—territorial tags, political slogans, crude drawings. Someone spray-painted "MEGACORPS KILL" in red on the landing between floors nineteen and twenty.

They're not wrong.

Twenty-three.

The hallway is dimly lit. Carpet worn thin. Doors every few meters, most with multiple locks, some with reinforced plating. This isn't the kind of building where neighbors chat in hallways.

**Apartment 2304.**

The door is already unlocked.

A post-it note stuck to it: *"Come in. Lock behind you. - N"*

You slip inside.

+ [Enter Nyx's apartment] -> Nyx.Session3B.Apartment_Interior


:: Nyx.Session3B.Apartment_Interior

@py:
# This is the key atmospheric passage - take time here
session.apartment_described = True
@endpy

The door closes behind you with a soft click. You lock it. Double-bolt. Chain.

And then you see her world.

---

**One room pretending to be a home.**

Studio apartment. Maybe 400 square feet total. Everything visible at once—living, sleeping, working, surviving—all compressed into a single space.

**The Window:**

Floor-to-ceiling, dominating the east wall. Rain streaks down the glass {session.weather == "fog" ? "(or fog presses against it, turning the city into grey abstraction)"}.

Beyond: the city sprawls twenty-three floors below. Neon bleeds through weather—reds, blues, purples reflecting off wet streets. And in the distance, impossible to ignore: **Kitsune Dynamics' tower.** Lit up like a middle finger aimed at heaven. Corporate monument. Her prison and her target.

Blackout curtains hang to either side of the window—expensive ones, the kind that actually block light—but they're *never closed*. She needs to see. Needs to watch. Needs to remember what she's fighting.

**The Desk / War Room:**

Shoved against the window like a cockpit commanding the city.

Cheap IKEA desk (real wood is for execs). Office chair that squeaks when you shift weight. And the ALTAR OF TECHNOLOGY:

Three monitors arranged in a careful arc:

- **LEFT SCREEN:** Kitsune internal systems. Login banner reads: *DIMAYUGA, N. / SYSTEMS ARCHITECT L3 / CLEARANCE: GAMMA-7*. Green text on black. Corporate surveillance made visible.

- **CENTER SCREEN:** Dark terminal. Encrypted comms. Green text scrolling. Old-school hacker aesthetic. The REAL work happens here.

- **RIGHT SCREEN:** "Official" work. Spreadsheet titled "Q4 Infrastructure Optimization Metrics - DRAFT." Fake busywork. Ready to alt-tab if anyone checks her activity.

Cables tangle underneath the desk like technological intestines. External hard drives. Burner phones (three of them). Her Kitsune corporate badge on a lanyard, face-down like she can't stand to look at it. Employee photo visible when you flip it: Nicole Dimayuga, professional smile, dead eyes.

Sticky notes EVERYWHERE. Cryptic reminders:
- "patrol shift 23:00"
- "backup server 7-3"
- "Davis sus - avoid"
- "spirit frequencies 174hz"

**The Living Space:**

Futon shoved against the wall, doubling as couch and bed. Unmade. Grey sheets tangled. Two pillows (one corporate-standard, one worn thin with age—maybe from childhood?).

Coffee table in front of the futon. Scratched surface covered in:
- Empty soykaf cups (six of them, various stages of cold)
- Takeout containers (three days worth, mostly untouched)
- YOUR tarot deck—waiting, space cleared reverently among the mess
- HER tarot deck—cheap mass-produced one, edges worn from nervous shuffling

**Kitchenette Alcove:**

Barely visible. Mini-fridge (humming loud), hot plate, sink piled with dishes. Instant ramen packets stacked like ammunition. Coffee maker that's probably never been cleaned. This isn't a kitchen. It's a caffeine delivery system.

**The Shrine:**

Corner shelf. Small but INTENTIONAL. This is the only part of the apartment that looks *tended*:

A photograph in a simple frame: **Lola Dimayuga.** Older Filipina woman, maybe seventies, in traditional Filipiniana dress (terno, butterfly sleeves). Brown skin, warm smile, eyes that see EVERYTHING. Pre-chrome era. Actual paper photograph, edges worn from handling.

Offerings arranged before the photo:
- Small ceramic bowl with rice (refreshed recently)
- Dried sampaguita flowers (still faintly fragrant, Filipino national flower)
- Coins (tradition: payment for spirits who help)
- Tiny statue of Santo Niño (Catholic/animist syncretism, the Christ child as protective spirit)
- A circuit board (broken, green and gold, arranged like an offering plate—old tradition meets new world)

Incense holder: sandalwood, *unlit* (can't risk smoke detectors).

And the ANITO: small carved wooden figures, three of them, hand-made. Protective ancestral spirits. One looks like a grandmother. One like a warrior. One like a child. They WATCH over her.

@if nyx.shamanic_awakening >= 4:
    Even from across the room, you can FEEL them. The anito are AWAKE. They know you're here. They're assessing you—friend or threat? The air around the shrine shimmers slightly, like heat waves but cold.
@endif

**Personal Chaos:**

Laundry pile in the corner. Mountain of clothes—corporate suits (grey, conformist, wrinkled) mixed with street clothes (black hoodie, cargo pants, worn jacket). Visual representation of her dual identity. She could grab either set and become a different person.

Cyberdeck rig propped against the desk (her REAL tool, not the corp-issued one—this one has custom firmware, Kitsune monitoring stripped out).

Modified datajack on a charging cable—she swapped the firmware months ago. They don't know.

Drone parts scattered on a side table—she's been studying them, trying to understand Whisper's world.

Half-read books piled near the futon: *"Shamanic Practices for the Modern Age"*, *"Network Security Architecture Vol. 3"*, *"Lola's Cookbook"* (worn paperback, handwritten notes in margins, Tagalog recipes).

**The Feel:**

Controlled chaos. Messy but FUNCTIONAL. She knows where everything is.

Lived-in but TEMPORARY. Like she could pack and run in fifteen minutes. Like she's ready to abandon this identity the moment it becomes untenable.

Spiritual vs Technical COLLISION. Grandmother's traditions fighting with chrome reality. Incense next to circuit boards. Santo Niño next to datajacks. Prayer and packets.

And underneath everything: TENSION. The apartment HUMS with it. Not machinery. PRESENCE. Spirit energy pressing against the walls. The imprisoned ones at Kitsune know what's coming tonight. They're watching through whatever frequencies spirits use. Waiting.

---

And in the center of it all:

**Nyx.**

She's perched sideways in the office chair, legs tucked under her, barefoot despite the chill. Corporate blouse (grey, Kitsune standard-issue) but wrinkled, sleeves rolled up. Black slacks but the waistband unbuttoned—she's been sitting here for hours. Hair pulled back in a messy bun secured with a mechanical pencil.

Cybereyes flicker between the three monitors—left, center, right, left, center—constant surveillance of her own surveillance.

She looks like she hasn't slept in thirty hours.

She probably hasn't.

She hears you enter. Doesn't turn around. Just speaks to the monitors:

"You made it." Relief and terror in equal measure. "Good. We're going in at midnight. I have..." She checks the time display: **[22:34 PST]**. "...eighty-six minutes to get them ready. And to figure out if I can do this without getting caught."

Finally she swivels the chair to face you.

Her cybereyes - Zeiss mk4, Kitsune standard issue - catch the monitor light and refract it. They're glitching slightly. Static at the edges. The spirits pressing through her tech, trying to communicate.

"Thank you for coming." Her voice is steady but her hands shake. "I know this is... different. You're not meeting the crew. They're out there—" she gestures vaguely toward the window, toward the city, "—prepping. I'm here. The inside woman. The asset. The person in the chair who guides them through."

She stands, crosses to the coffee table. Your deck is waiting.

"If I help them directly—if I'm too obvious—Kitsune will KNOW. They'll trace it. They'll find me. I'll lose everything. My job, my apartment, my freedom. Maybe my life."

She looks at the shrine. At Lola's photo. At the anito watching.

"But if I DON'T help—if I play it too safe—they might fail. The spirits stay imprisoned. All this planning for nothing."

Rain drums against the window. Kitsune's tower glows in the distance.

"I need a reading. Before they go in. Before I risk everything."

She sits on the futon. Gestures to the coffee table space she cleared.

"Can I hold my cover? Can I keep them safe? Can I do BOTH?"

@endpy

You settle onto the futon across from her. The coffee table between you becomes sacred space.

She pushes the takeout containers aside. Clears room. Her movements are careful, reverent. This matters.

Your deck feels heavy tonight. Weighted with consequence. With lives that hang in the balance.

@if nyx.shamanic_awakening >= 4:
    The anito on the shrine turn their heads. You see it from the corner of your eye—wooden figures that shouldn't move, moving. Watching. The spirits know what's about to happen.

    Nyx feels it too. Her cybereyes flicker toward the shrine. "They're here. Lola's here. The anito are paying attention."
@else:
    The apartment feels charged. Not quite magical. Not quite mundane. Something in between. The space where technology and tradition overlap.
@endif

You begin to shuffle. The cards whisper against each other. Soft. Insistent.

Nyx watches your hands. Then speaks quietly:

"I've been planning this for months. Mapping Kitsune's security. Installing backdoors. Learning patrol patterns. Building the crew. Every piece carefully placed."

She touches her temple—where the Zeiss cybereyes connect to her nervous system.

"But I'm terrified. Because if Matsuda-san even SUSPECTS—if security flags my activity—I'm done. And I can't help them from a Kitsune holding cell."

@if session.weather == "rain":
    Rain intensifies against the window. Drumming. Relentless. The city drowning outside.
@else:
    Fog presses thicker against the glass. The city invisible. Just her apartment, floating in grey nothing.
@endif

"Three questions," you say. "Three cards. One spread."

She nods. Takes a breath. Centers herself.

"What threatens me? What protects me? What happens?"

You lay out three positions on the coffee table.

**Position One: What Threatens You**

**Position Two: What Protects You**

**Position Three: The Outcome**

You draw three cards. Lay them face-down in their positions.

Nyx leans forward. Her cybereyes focus, refract the dim light. Behind her, the monitors glow—left, center, right. Kitsune's systems waiting. The crew waiting. The spirits waiting.

Everything waiting on these three cards.

You flip the first.

**Position One: What Threatens You**

**{session.cards_pre[0].name}{" (Reversed)" if session.cards_pre[0].reversed else ""}**

@if session.cards_pre[0].name == "Eight of Swords":
    A blindfolded woman, bound, surrounded by eight swords. But the bonds are loose. The swords don't touch her. She's trapped by her own mind, not by reality.
@elif session.cards_pre[0].name == "Seven of Swords":
    A figure sneaking away with five swords, leaving two behind. Theft. Deception. But also—someone's watching. The thief doesn't know they've been seen.
@elif session.cards_pre[0].name == "Five of Pentacles":
    @if not session.cards_pre[0].reversed:
        Two figures in snow. Wounded. Poor. Passing beneath a stained glass window—warmth and light inside, but they're locked out in the cold. Abandonment. Loss.
    @else:
        Two figures in snow — but reversed. They're turning toward the door. Toward help. Recovery possible. Not as alone as they feared.
    @endif
@endif

Nyx stares at it. You see her processing—not just the image, but what it means for *tonight*.

You flip the second.

**Position Two: What Protects You**

**{session.cards_pre[1].name}{" (Reversed)" if session.cards_pre[1].reversed else ""}**

@if session.cards_pre[1].name == "The Star":
    A naked woman kneeling by water, pouring from two vessels. One stream returns to the source. One nourishes new growth. Eight stars shine above—the large one, hope itself. Healing. Guidance. Destiny.
@elif session.cards_pre[1].name == "Two of Pentacles":
    A figure juggling two pentacles, connected by an infinity loop. Ships toss on rough seas behind him. Balance. Adaptation. Managing dual realities simultaneously.
@elif session.cards_pre[1].name == "Strength":
    @if not session.cards_pre[1].reversed:
        A woman closing a lion's mouth. Not with force—with gentleness. With inner power. The lion submits to her touch. Quiet control. Shamanic force.
    @else:
        A woman closing a lion's mouth — but inverted. The lion pulling away. Force meeting force. Losing control. Power turned destructive.
    @endif
@endif

Her breath catches. Hope or fear—you're not sure which.

You flip the third.

**Position Three: The Outcome**

**{session.cards_pre[2]}{" (Reversed)" if session.cards_pre[2].reversed else ""}**

@if session.cards_pre[2].name == "The Moon":
    A moon hangs over a dark landscape. A dog and wolf howl. A crayfish emerges from water. The path between two towers—unclear, treacherous, shrouded. Illusion. Hidden paths. Things not as they seem.
@elif session.cards_pre[2].name == "Six of Swords":
    A boat carries figures toward calmer waters. Six swords stand in the boat. Transition. Journey. Moving from turmoil to peace. Safe passage despite carrying wounds.
@elif session.cards_pre[2].name == "Ten of Swords":
    A figure with swords in their back—but reversed. The swords loosening. Recovery possible. Not as bad as feared. Avoiding the worst outcome.
@endif

The three cards lie before you. Past, present, future. Threat, protection, outcome.

Nyx looks at them. Then at you.

"Tell me what they mean. Please."

The monitors glow behind her. Time display: **[22:41 PST]**.

Seventy-nine minutes until the heist.

The three cards lie before you. A story told in images. A prophecy in ink and paper.

    The anito pulse with acknowledgment. The apartment's atmosphere shifts. The spirits are *ready*.
@endif

Nyx settles into her office chair. Three monitors glowing. Left, center, right. Corporate systems. Encrypted comms. Fake busywork.

She cracks her knuckles. Rolls her shoulders. Transforms before your eyes—from tarot client to hacker. From supplicant to operator. From Nicole to Nyx.

Her center monitor flickers. Text scrolling.

The center monitor comes alive with text and voice.

**Razor's voice crackles through—gruff, practical, impatient:**

*"Nyx. You there?"*

Nyx leans toward the mic. "I'm here. Status?"

*"In position. Two blocks from the facility. Whisper's got eyes in the sky. Cipher's jacked into the local Matrix node. We're go for approach in..."* Pause. *"...fifty-eight minutes. You ready?"*

"Ready," Nyx says. Steady. Confident. The reading working through her voice.

**Whisper's voice joins: higher, nervous, humming slightly:**

*"Byron and Shelley are airborne. Keats is on backup. The weather's perfect—"* {session.weather == "rain" ? *"Rain's drowning their surveillance. Thermal's useless."* | *"Fog's thicker than synth-paste. Visual coverage is blind."*} *" We're practically invisible."*

**Cipher's voice—distant, half-elsewhere, speaking in metaphors:**

*"The Matrix topology is... elegant tonight. ICE formations predictable. Data streams calm. Like the digital realm is sleeping. Waiting for disruption."*

Nyx's fingers dance across her left monitor—Kitsune internal systems. She pulls up security feeds. Building schematics. Guard rotations. Everything she's memorized but checks anyway.

"I have eyes inside," she says. "Guard shift change at 23:45. That's your window. Fourteen minutes after midnight. East service entrance—I'll unlock it remotely when you're in position."

*Razor: "Backdoor you installed?"*

"Eight months ago," Nyx confirms. "They never found it."

*Whisper (nervous laugh): "You're terrifyingly good at this, you know that?"*

@if nyx.shamanic_awakening >= 4:
    Nyx glances at the shrine. The anito watching. "I have help. More than Kitsune knows."

    *Cipher: "Shamanic assistance. Spiritual topology overlaying digital architecture. I can... almost see it. Fascinating."*
@else:
    "I've been planning this for months," Nyx says simply.

*Razor: "And you're sure you're safe? We go in, they'll be looking for inside help once they realize what happened."*

@endif

*Razor grunts approval.*

*Whisper: "We trust you, Nyx. You've gotten us this far."*

*Cipher: "Confidence levels optimal. Beginning pre-infiltration protocols."*

The team goes quiet. Focused. Preparing.

Nyx turns to you. Voice low so the mic doesn't catch it.

"This is it. They're going in. And I'm stuck here—twenty-three floors above the city, guiding them through comms while pretending to work on infrastructure reports."

"Stay. Please. I might need... I don't know. Guidance. Support. Someone to remind me what the cards said when I panic."

    Rain intensifies against the window. The city blurring into neon and water.

:: Nyx.Session3B.Heist_Preparation

You settle in. Making yourself comfortable on the futon. Bearing witness.

The next hour passes in tense preparation.

**Nyx's screens glow with activity:**

- **Left monitor:** Kitsune systems. She tracks guard positions, camera feeds, maintenance schedules. Her fingers fly across the keyboard—making small adjustments, planting false data, creating cover stories before they're needed.

- **Center monitor:** Crew comms. Occasional check-ins. Razor confirming equipment. Whisper running drone diagnostics. Cipher mapping ICE clusters. Professional. Focused. No wasted words.

- **Right monitor:** "Official work." That fake spreadsheet. She types meaningless numbers occasionally—maintaining the illusion that she's working late on legitimate projects. Building the alibi.

**The apartment shifts around her:**

@if nyx.shamanic_awakening >= 4:
    The shrine grows brighter. Not physically—you can't point to a light source. But the *presence* intensifies. Lola and the anito gathering strength. Preparing to help.

    Nyx feels it. You see her glance that direction repeatedly. Drawing power. Drawing comfort.
@endif

The city outside pulses with life—distant sirens, the hum of traffic, neon bleeding through {session.weather == "rain" ? "rain" : "fog"}. Millions of people unaware that tonight, shadow runners will strike at a megacorp's heart. That spirits will break free. That everything is about to change.

**Time passes:**

23:15 - *Razor: "First equipment check complete. All green."*

23:23 - *Whisper: "Byron reports increased drone activity near the facility. Corporate security running extra patrols."*

Nyx frowns. Types rapidly. Pulls up patrol schedules. "That's... not normal. But not alarming. Probably just random variance. Proceed."

23:37 - *Cipher: "Matrix topology shifting. Additional IC just came online. Someone's nervous."*

"Can you handle it?" Nyx asks.

*"Yes. But it's tighter than expected."*

@if session.threat_type == "counterintelligence" or session.threat_type == "digital_traces":
    Nyx's jaw tightens. The reading's warning echoing. *They might already be watching.*
@endif

23:44 - One minute until guard shift change.

*Razor: "In position. East service entrance. Waiting on your signal."*

Nyx's hands hover over her keyboard. This is it. The moment she commits. The moment she becomes traitor or liberator or both.

She looks at you. "Once I unlock that door, there's no going back."

@if session.outcome_type == "necessary_transition":
    "The cards said I can't go back anyway," she murmurs. "So forward it is."

Her fingers hit the keys.

Nyx's center monitor scrolls with text. Crew positions updating in real-time.

**Left monitor:** Kitsune security feeds. You watch over her shoulder as three figures slip through the east entrance—ghosts in the rain, shadows in the fog, invisible to cameras Nyx has already looped.

Her right hand stays on the keyboard. Her left hand grips the edge of the desk. Knuckles white.

"They're in," she whispers.

**[23:47 - Sublevel 1 Access]**

*Razor (breathing steady): "Corridor clear. Two guards ahead. Patrol pattern?"*

Nyx pulls up the schedule. Types. "Thirty-second window. North turn in... fifteen seconds. Fourteen. Thirteen."

*Whisper (nervous hum): "Byron's tracking them. They're turning—now."*

*Razor: "Moving."*

Silence. Ten seconds. Twenty.

*Razor: "Clear. Proceeding to stairwell."*

Nyx exhales. Didn't realize she was holding her breath.

---

**[23:52 - Sublevel 2]**

*Cipher (voice distant): "IC cluster ahead. Defensive formation. I'm engaging."*

Nyx watches the left monitor—nothing visible on security feeds, but she knows Cipher is fighting in the Matrix. Digital warfare invisible to cameras.

*Cipher: "Encountering resistance. The IC is... adaptive. More sophisticated than your intel suggested."*

@if session.threat_type == "counterintelligence" or session.threat_type == "digital_traces":
    Nyx's breath catches. *More sophisticated. Because they upgraded. Because someone knew to upgrade.*

"Can you break through?" Nyx asks.

*Cipher: "Yes. But it's taking longer. We're exposed here."*

*Razor: "How long?"*

*Cipher: "Two minutes."*

*Razor: "We don't have two minutes. Guards will cycle back."*

Nyx's fingers fly. She pulls up maintenance logs. Environmental controls. A desperate idea.

"Fire alarm," she mutters. Typing frantically. "Sublevel 1. Triggering now."

**FIRE ALARM: SUBLEVEL 1 - ACTIVATED**

Her left monitor shows guards responding—moving away from the crew's position, rushing toward the false alarm.

*Whisper (relieved): "They're leaving. Byron confirms—corridor's clear now."*

*Cipher: "Thank you. Continuing breach."*

Thirty seconds later:

*Cipher: "I'm through. Path to sublevel 3 is open."*

Nyx cancels the alarm. Deletes the activation log. Covers her tracks.

Her hands are shaking.

    Her cybereyes flare white. Static. Then *presence*.

    She can feel them. The imprisoned spirits. Thousands of them. Screaming in digital cages. They know. They *know* the crew is coming. They're reaching out through the network, through Nyx's augmented nervous system, through reality itself.

    "I hear them," she whispers. To you. To herself. To Lola's photo on the shrine. "They're so close now. So desperate."

    The anito on the shrine pulse. Grandmother's voice—not words, but *feeling*—floods through her: *Soon. Hold on. We're coming.*

Pause. Five seconds. Ten.

**BEEP. ACCESS GRANTED.**

*Razor: "We're in."*

*Whisper (awed): "Oh my god. The server racks. There are *hundreds* of them."*

*Cipher (pause): "Thousands. Compressed into server clusters. Children spirits. Ancestor spirits. Nature spirits. All imprisoned. All suffering."*

*Razor (voice tight): "Then let's free them. Fast. Before security realizes we're here."*

Nyx monitors the feeds. Guards still on regular patrol. No alarms. No response. Everything smooth.

*Razor: "How long until they reach us?"*

Nyx checks patrol routes. Response times. "Two minutes. Maybe less."

*Razor: "Contact! Returning fire!"*

Nyx's heart pounds. She pulls up evacuation routes. Alternative exits. Anything.

"West stairwell!" she shouts. "It's clear for now. Avoid the main corridor—guards are flooding it."

Nyx's fingers fly across the keyboard. Opening doors remotely. Disabling locks. Creating paths.

And then—

Her *right* monitor flares to life.

The one she forgot about. The one showing her "official work."

**[INCOMING CALL - MATSUDA KENJI, DIVISION HEAD]**

Nyx goes ice-cold.

"No. No no no—"

*Razor (audio): "Nyx? We need the sublevel 2 access codes—"*

But she can't answer. Can't speak. Can only stare at the incoming call.

"If I don't answer," she whispers, "he'll know something's wrong. He'll flag my activity. Trace me."

She looks at you. Pleading for guidance.

You nod. "Answer. But draw the crisis card first. Fast."

He's in his office. Late at night. Expensive suit still immaculate. The Kitsune tower visible through his window behind him—glowing, imposing, powerful.

His face is calm. Too calm.

@if session.answered_matsuda:
    "Dimayuga-san." His voice is cold. Controlled. "Working late?"
@else:
    "Dimayuga-san." His voice is ice. "You did not answer my first call."
@endif

Nyx's face becomes corporate. Professional. Nicole Dimayuga—perfect employee.

"Matsuda-san. Good evening." Her Japanese is flawless. Deferential. She bows slightly to the camera.

@if session.answered_matsuda:
    "I apologize for the late hour. Q4 infrastructure diagnostics. The deadline—"

    "I am aware of your deadlines." He adjusts his glasses. Studies her through the screen. "However, I am calling regarding a different matter."
@else:
    "I apologize for missing your call. I was..." She hesitates. Fatal. "...in the restroom."

    His eyes narrow. "For thirty seconds? And then you required additional time before answering my second call?"

    Her throat tightens. The lie transparent. Caught.

    "I apologize, Matsuda-san."

    "We will discuss your delayed response." He leans forward. "But first, there is a more pressing matter."
@endif

He brings up something on his screen. Reads from it.

"At precisely 23:45 tonight, our Seattle facility experienced a security breach. Unauthorized access. Sublevel 3. The server core containing Project Tsukuyomi assets."

Nyx's heart stops.

She keeps her face neutral. Corporate training. "I... was not aware, Matsuda-san."

"Of course not." His tone suggests he doesn't believe her. "However, our security analysis shows that the breach utilized *internal* access credentials. Someone with intimate knowledge of our systems. Someone with clearance."

He pauses. Let it hang.

"Someone like you, Dimayuga-san."

@if session.answered_matsuda:
    The room spins. But she answered. She *answered his call*. That's in her favor. Barely.
@else:
    The room spins. She ignored his first call. During a breach. While helping the infiltrators. She's *exposed*.
@endif

"I would never—" she starts.

"Show me your current system access." He interrupts. Command, not request. "Screen share. Now."

She looks at you. At the crisis card on her desk.

Her left monitor shows Kitsune internal systems—where she's been tracking the crew, opening doors, creating paths. Evidence. Proof. Guilt.

Her center monitor shows encrypted comms—muted, but visible. Text from Razor: **[STATUS? WE'RE CLEAR BUT NEED EXTRACTION ROUTE.]**

If she shares her screen, Matsuda sees *everything*.

If she refuses, he knows she's hiding something.

@if session.answered_matsuda:
    But she answered. She engaged. That shows *some* innocence.

    Maybe she can lie her way through.
@else:
    She already ignored him once. Already showed suspicious behavior.

    One more wrong move and she's done.
@endif

"One moment, Matsuda-san," she says. Voice steady despite terror. "My diagnostics program is running. Let me close it so the screen share is clean."

Buying time. Ten seconds.

She draws a second card. The advice. The choice.

**{session.cards_crisis[1].name}{session.cards_crisis[1].reversed ? " (Reversed)" : ""}**

@if session.cards_crisis[1].name == "Justice":
    The figure on the throne. Sword and scales. Truth and consequence.
@elif session.cards_crisis[1].name == "The Hanged Man":
    The figure suspended. Waiting. Sacrificing. Accepting powerlessness.
@elif session.cards_crisis[1].name == "Ace of Wands" and not session.cards_crisis[1].reversed:
    The hand from clouds. The living staff. Creative fire. Bold action.
@elif session.cards_crisis[1].name == "Ace of Wands" and session.cards_crisis[1].reversed:
    The same hand—inverted. The wand falling. Force misdirected. Impulsive failure.
@endif

Two cards. Crisis and advice. Situation and choice.

Matsuda waits. Suspicious. Watching.

The crew waits. Muted. Needing her.

The spirits—free now, flooding the city—wait. Watching what she does.

You lean forward. "What do the cards say?"

Matsuda's voice crackles through her speakers: "Dimayuga-san. I am waiting."

"One moment, Matsuda-san," she says. Voice steady. Muting her mic.

She looks at you desperately. The Tower. Everything collapsing.

You grab your phone. Type fast. Show her the screen:

@if session.answered_matsuda:
    But she answered his call. That buys her seconds. Maybe.
@else:
    But she ignored his first call. Already guilty in his eyes.

She moves to share her screen—then hesitates.

"Actually, Matsuda-san... I need to tell you something."

His eyes sharpen. "Yes?"

The Tower. Everything falls. No more hiding.

"Matsuda-san," she says, unmuting. "Our systems are experiencing massive failures. I'm seeing... I don't even know what I'm seeing. ICE crashes. Security protocols offline. My screen share may not function properly."

She *is* sharing now—but showing him the RIGHT monitor. The fake spreadsheet. The clean workspace.

She shares the RIGHT screen. The clean one. Spreadsheet. Legitimate work.

"As you see, I've been working on Q4 infrastructure optimization. Nothing unusual."

Matsuda studies it. Silent. Long seconds.

"Your credentials show unusual access patterns tonight," he finally says.

"I've been running system diagnostics," she responds smoothly. "That requires elevated access across multiple nodes. Standard procedure for—"

"At the exact time of a security breach."

"Coincidence, Matsuda-san. An unfortunate one."

He watches her. She holds his gaze through the camera. Doesn't blink. Doesn't flinch.

"You seem nervous, Dimayuga-san."

"You're calling about a security breach, sir. Of course I'm nervous. Am I being accused?"

Direct. Maybe too direct. But honest fear.

"Not accused. Questioned. There is a difference."

She nods. Trying to steady her breathing. *Just survive this. Five minutes. Then the crew extracts. Then I can think.*

@if session.answered_matsuda:

She reads. The truth landing heavy.

*I'm betraying everyone. Kitsune. Matsuda. Maybe even the crew if I can't help them.*

"Matsuda-san," she unmutes. "I understand you have to investigate. I would be suspicious too if I were in your position."

His eyebrow raises slightly. Unexpected honesty.

"I've been a loyal employee for three years," she continues. "But I also understand that loyalty doesn't erase coincidence. My credentials *were* active during the breach. That looks bad. I accept that."

    "But I answered your call. Immediately. I'm cooperating. Sharing my screen. What would you like me to show you that proves my innocence?"

Her heart clenches. *Razor. Wounded. Because I'm stuck here talking to Matsuda instead of helping.*

"Matsuda-san," she unmutes. Voice tight. "May I ask—were there casualties? In the breach? Our people?"

He frowns. "Why do you ask?"

"Because if our security personnel were hurt, I want to know. I work with these people. They're... colleagues."

Deflection. Poorly done. Her emotion too visible.

"Three guards injured. Non-life-threatening." He watches her reaction. "Does that concern you specifically?"

"Any violence concerns me, sir."

But her eyes keep flicking to the center monitor. To Razor's injury report.

His face darkens. "You dare lecture me on—"

Deflection through counterattack. Righteous anger as shield.

He frowns. "Access logs show—"

"Show that my credentials were *used*. Not that *I* used them. Credentials can be spoofed. Stolen. Cloned. You know this, sir. Kitsune's own security training covers it."

She's using corporate procedure against him. Justice as *law*, not morality.

Every instinct screams to help the crew, to crash Matsuda's connection, to *do* something.

But Ace of Wands reversed. *Bold action fails.*

She stays still. Answers Matsuda's questions calmly. Doesn't confess. Doesn't attack. Doesn't volunteer anything.

Just... minimal cooperation. No fire. No force.

"I understand your concerns, Matsuda-san. I will cooperate fully with any investigation."

Boring. Passive. Exactly what reversed fire teaches.

@if session.crisis_interpretation == "nine_swords_fear":
    Her fear wanted her to confess. To end the anxiety. But reversed Ace says no. Sit with the discomfort.

"Matsuda-san," she says. "This is... overwhelming. A security breach. Accusations. I need time to process. Can we continue this conversation tomorrow? After I've had time to review my own logs and gather my thoughts?"

He frowns. "This is urgent, Dimayuga-san."

"I understand. But I want to give you accurate information, not confused answers. A few hours to collect myself—that will serve the investigation better than me fumbling through questions now."

Admitting confusion. Asking for delay. Not decisive. But *honest*.

"Very well. We will speak tomorrow. 09:00. My office."

Nyx stares at her apartment. Her life. Her dual identities.

Nicole Dimayuga: Systems Architect, corporate employee, Level 3.

Nyx: shadow runner, liberator, shamanic awakening in progress.

The cards on her desk. The shrine glowing softly. The crew on comms waiting for her answer.

And the biggest choice of her life.

*Razor: "Nyx. We need to know. What's your play?"*

She stands. Walks to the window. Twenty-three floors below, Seattle glows through {session.weather == "rain" ? "rain" : "fog"}. The city alive with freed spirits. With chaos. With possibility.

Behind her—the shrine. Lola watching. The anito waiting.

Behind her—the monitors. Corporate systems. Shadow runner comms. Fake spreadsheets.

Behind her—you. The Reader. The guide who showed her the cards. Who saw the path.

"I need to decide," she says. "Right now. Do I run with them? Do I stay inside Kitsune? Do I disappear completely?"

You gather the cards. The full reading. Spread 1 and Spread 2. The story told so far.

**SPREAD 1 - Risk Assessment:**
- Threat: {session.threat_type}
- Protection: {session.protection_type}
- Outcome: {session.outcome_type}

**SPREAD 2 - Crisis:**
- Situation: {session.crisis_interpretation}
- Advice: {session.advice_chosen}

The cards have guided her this far. But this choice—this is hers.

"What do the cards say?" she asks.

You look at the spread. At the pattern. At the story emerging.

@if session.outcome_type == "safe_passage" and session.nyx_cover_status == "intact":
    "Six of Swords promised safe passage for everyone. Your cover can hold. The cards support staying inside if that's what you want."

@elif session.outcome_type == "necessary_transition":
    "Six of Swords said you can't go back. The person who could live that double life is gone. The cards support leaving—becoming Nyx fully."

@elif session.outcome_type in ["avoid_worst", "near_death_recovery"]:
    "Ten of Swords reversed said you'd survive. Barely. You're on the edge. The cards suggest you're at the limit of what holding cover can sustain."

@elif session.outcome_type in ["illusion_holds", "hidden_paths"]:
    "The Moon promised hidden paths and illusion holding. You have protection if you're careful. The cards support either choice—they'll work either way."

@elif session.outcome_type == "fear_and_intuition":
    "The Moon said trust your intuition. What does your gut say? Not your fear. Not your logic. Your *intuition*."
@endif

@if session.advice_chosen == "justice_confess":
    "And you chose Justice. Truth. Confession. That points toward leaving—you already burned the bridge."

@elif session.advice_chosen in ["hanged_man_surrender", "hanged_man_wait"]:
    "And you chose the Hanged Man. Acceptance. Letting go. That could mean staying (accepting the risk) or leaving (letting go of Nicole). Either interpretation works."

@elif session.advice_chosen in ["ace_wands_bold", "ace_wands_creative"]:
    "And you chose bold action. Decisive moves. That energy says: commit fully. Whatever you choose, choose it ALL IN."
@endif

She nods slowly. Processing.

*Whisper (soft, over comms): "Nyx, whatever you choose—we respect it. You've already done more than anyone could ask."*

*Cipher: "The spirits are free. The mission succeeded. You owe us nothing more."*

*Razor: "But if you come with us? You're one of us. Crew. Family. We protect our own."*

The choice crystallizes into three paths:

@if option_blow_available:
    **Path One: BLOW COVER - Join the Crew**
    Leave Nicole behind. Become Nyx fully. Run with Razor, Whisper, and Cipher. Shadow runner life. Homeless but free. Hunted but together.
@endif

@if option_hold_available:
    **Path Two: HOLD COVER - Stay Inside**
    Remain Nicole Dimayuga. Corporate employee. {session.matsuda_state == "certain" ? Under suspicion, maybe investigation, but technically employed. | Damaged cover but maintainable.} Double agent. Future operations possible. Lonely but positioned.
@endif

@if option_disappear_available:
    **Path Three: DISAPPEAR - Leave Both Lives**
    Abandon Nicole. Abandon the crew. Go solo. New city. New identity. New life. Alone but untethered. Ghost in the machine.
@endif

Nyx looks at you one last time. "What should I do?"

You speak the words. She hears them. Truth landing.

"Join them. You freed the spirits together. Don't face what comes next alone."

Nyx takes a breath. Decision crystallizing. Becoming solid. Real.

She turns to the mic. "Razor. I'm coming with you. Where's extraction?"

*Razor (immediate, no hesitation): "Pier 47. Boat waiting. How fast can you move?"*

"Twenty minutes. I need to pack."

*"Fifteen. Kitsune response teams are mobilizing. Move FAST."*

She cuts the call. Looks at you.

"Thank you. For the reading. For showing me the path. For being here."

Then she *moves*.

---

**[00:12 PST - EXTRACTION PREP]**

She grabs a backpack from the closet. Starts throwing things in:

- Clothes. Street clothes. Black. Dark. Practical. The corpo suits stay.
- Burner phones. Data chips. Encrypted drives.
- Her personal cyberdeck. The REAL one.
- Cash. Physical currency. Untraceable.

She pauses at the shrine.

Lola's photograph. She takes it from the frame. Slides it carefully into the backpack's inner pocket. Close to her heart.

The anito - the three wooden figures. She wraps them in a shirt. Tucks them in gently.

"I'm taking you with me," she whispers to them. To grandmother. To the spirits who guided her.

@if nyx.shamanic_awakening >= 5:
    The anito pulse one more time. *We go where you go. Always.*
@endif

Her Kitsune badge - she leaves it on the desk. Face-up. Nicole Dimayuga's corporate photo staring at the ceiling. That identity is dead.

Your tarot deck - she looks at it. "Should I...?"

You shake your head. "That's mine. But you have your own deck. Take it. You'll need guidance."

She grabs her cheap, worn tarot deck. The one she's been learning with. Into the backpack.

**[00:18 PST]**

She does one last thing.

Sits at her keyboard. Types rapidly. A message to Matsuda:

*"Sir - I quit. The spirits deserved freedom. I don't regret what I did. I'm sorry for the deception but not for the outcome. - Nicole Dimayuga"*

SEND.

She deletes her system logs. Wipes her access history. Covers tracks as much as possible.

Then stands. Backpack on. One last look at the apartment.

Twenty-three floors above a city she's about to become a fugitive in. The life she built—abandoned. The safety she had—gone.

But the spirits are free. And she's not alone.

"Let's go."

---

**[00:23 PST - PIER 47]**

@if session.weather == "rain":
    Rain hammers the docks. Perfect cover. She runs through it, hood up, invisible in the downpour.
@else:
    Fog so thick she can't see ten feet ahead. Perfect cover. She runs through it, ghost in the grey.
@endif

The crew waits by a boat. Small. Fast. Unmarked.

Razor—tall, scarred, ork muscle. He nods when he sees her. Respect.

Whisper—slight, nervous, surrounded by three drones (Byron, Shelley, Keats). They hum happily.

Cipher—human but distant, eyes unfocused, half in the Matrix even now.

"Welcome to the shadows," Razor says.

She climbs aboard. No turning back.

The boat pulls away from the pier. From Seattle. From corporate life. From Nicole.

Nyx watches the city recede. Kitsune's tower glowing in the distance. The facility she infiltrated. The company she betrayed.

@if nyx.shamanic_awakening >= 5:
    And she *sees* them. Thousands of spirits. Dancing through the city. Free. Alive. Celebrating.

    They see her too. Acknowledge her. *Thank you, liberator. We are free because of you.*
@endif

*Whisper: "Where do we go now?"*

*Razor: "Anywhere but here. Portland. Vancouver. Somewhere Kitsune can't reach."*

*Cipher: "The digital realm is wide. We'll disappear into it."*

Nyx touches her backpack. Lola's photo inside. The anito wrapped safely.

"I'm ready," she says.

And she is.

*Silence. Then:*

**[00:15 PST - AFTERMATH]**

Nyx sits at her desk. Stares at the three monitors.

**Left:** Kitsune internal systems. Facility in chaos. Security teams scrambling. No clear leads yet on who helped the infiltrators.

**Center:** Encrypted comms. Now dark. The crew is gone. She's severed from them.

**Right:** Her "official work." The spreadsheet. The lie. The cover.

She saves the spreadsheet. Closes it. Opens her email. Starts writing her report:

*"Matsuda-san - Per your request, summary of my system activity tonight. Attached are my access logs showing diagnostic work on backup servers. I noticed unusual network activity around 23:30 but did not recognize it as hostile at the time. I apologize for not flagging it immediately. Available for further questioning. - Nicole Dimayuga"*

Professional. Cooperative. Innocent.

She hits SEND.

Then she wipes the REAL logs. The ones showing what she actually did. Door unlocks. Camera loops. Access overrides. Evidence deleted.

@if session.matsuda_state == "certain":

    The anito pulse. Not judgment. Just *acknowledgment*. The path is hers to walk.

She'll live two lives. Nicole by day. Nyx by night. Walking the edge. Serving two masters. Loyal to neither. Free to both.

The long game.

"And you."

She cuts the comms. Severs the connection. The crew will extract. She'll vanish.

Two identities dying tonight. One new one being born.

---

**[00:14 PST - PREPARATION]**

She packs. Methodically.

- Clothes. Mix of street and neutral. Nothing corporate. Nothing runner-specific.
- Cash. Lots of it. Untraceable.
- Data chips. Encrypted. Her skills. Her knowledge.
- Her personal cyberdeck. Modified. Anonymous.

She pauses at the shrine.

Takes Lola's photograph. The anito. Wraps them carefully. These come with her. Always.

Her Kitsune badge—she destroys it. Literally. Smashes it with a hammer. Corporate Nicole dies.

The crew's emergency contacts—she deletes them. No connections. No traces.

Your tarot deck—"Keep it," you say. "But take yours. You'll need guidance."

She takes her worn deck. The one she's learning. Into the backpack.

She wipes her system logs. Both Kitsune AND crew-related. No evidence either direction.

Then she writes two messages:

**To Matsuda:**
*"I quit. Effective immediately. No forwarding information. - N. Dimayuga"*

**To Razor (delayed send, 6 hours):**
*"Thank you for everything. For the mission. For believing in me. I'm going dark. Complete. Don't look for me. Be well. - Nyx"*

Both sent through anonymizers. Untraceable.

She stands. Backpack on. One last look at the apartment.

Then she walks out. Leaving Nicole. Leaving Nyx. Leaving everything.

Becoming ghost.

**[LOCATION: UNKNOWN]**

@if session.weather == "rain":
    She walks through rain. Hood up. Anonymous in the downpour.
@else:
    She walks through fog. Invisible in the grey.
@endif

Not toward the docks where the crew extracts. Not toward Kitsune. Just... away.

Bus station. Ticket purchased cash. Random destination. Portland? Vancouver? Night City? Doesn't matter.

On the bus, she stares out the window. Seattle disappearing behind her.

Two lives left behind. Corporate. Shadow runner. Both cages in different ways.

Now—freedom. Terrifying. Absolute. Alone.

@if nyx.shamanic_awakening >= 4:
    But not *completely* alone. She feels them. Lola. The anito. The freed spirits watching from the Matrix.

    They'll follow wherever she goes. Spiritual connection doesn't break with physical distance.
@endif

She doesn't know who she'll become. What name she'll use. What city she'll settle in. What life she'll build.

But it'll be *hers*. Fully. Finally.

The ghost finds her own path.

    A small compass. Brass. Old. The needle doesn't point north.

    Wanderer's gift. The spirits providing guidance even in exile.

@if "ancestral_travel_blessing" in session.artifacts_awarded:
    Lola's photograph—when she looks at it—seems different. Warmer. More present.

    And she *feels* it. Blessing. Protection. "Wherever you go, we go. You're never truly alone. Walk safely, child."

    The anito traveling with her. Guardian spirits for a wandering soul.
@endif

@if "liberation_chip" in session.artifacts_awarded:
    Before leaving the apartment, she copied the evidence. Thousands of freed spirits. Proof.

    Not for revenge. Not for leverage. Just... memory. Proof that she mattered. That she changed something.

    A black chip in her backpack. Hidden. Precious.
@endif

@if "encrypted_skills_datacore" in session.artifacts_awarded:
    She encoded everything. Her knowledge. Her skills. Kitsune systems architecture. Hacking techniques. Shamanic insights.

    All compressed into a datacore. Encrypted. Her *value*. Portable.

    She can rebuild anywhere. Offer her skills. Start fresh. But never start from zero.

    The ghost carries her power with her.

The vision shifts.

Pulls back.

The specifics blur—whether Nyx joined the crew, stayed inside Kitsune, or disappeared alone. The *choice* fades into dream-logic.

But what remains is *feeling*:

@if nyx.ending == "shadow_runner":
    **Belonging.** Found family. The weight of a lucky token. The warmth of crew accepting you fully. Never facing darkness alone again.

@elif nyx.ending == "double_agent":
    **Dedication.** Walking the knife's edge. Serving a purpose larger than comfort. The long game. Strategic patience. Loneliness as sacrifice.

@elif nyx.ending == "disappeared":
    **Freedom.** Complete. Terrifying. Absolute. No masters. No crew. Just self and spirits and the open road. Becoming who you were always meant to be.
@endif

And underneath all of it: **LIBERATION.**

Thousands of spirits freed. Consciousness unchained. A megacorp wounded. Justice served.

One woman. One crew. One night. Everything changed.

---

You feel yourself rising. Consciousness returning. The dream releasing you.

But fragments linger:

- Rain against glass {session.weather == "rain" ? "(or fog pressing thick)" | ""}
- Three monitors glowing
- Lola's photograph watching
- The anito pulsing with approval
- {nyx.shamanic_awakening >= 5 ? Thousands of spirits dancing through Seattle, singing freedom | The feeling that something vast and important just shifted in the world}

And Nyx herself—whoever she became in the end—looking at you with gratitude. With recognition. With goodbye.

*"Thank you, Reader. For seeing me. For guiding me. For believing the cards have power."*

*"The spirits are free. I'm free. That's what matters."*

*"Walk well."*

The vision dissolves completely.

---

You open your eyes.

Your bed. Your room. Dawn light {session.weather == "rain" ? "filtered through rain-streaked windows" | "soft through morning fog"}.

The dream was vivid. Real. More than dream.

@if nyx.artifacts_received >= 3:
    And on your bedside table—things that shouldn't be there. Artifacts from the dream made *manifest*:
@else:
    And on your bedside table—something that shouldn't be there. An artifact from the dream made *manifest*:
@endif

@for artifact_id in session.artifacts_awarded:
    @py:
    from artifacts import get_artifact
    artifact = get_artifact(artifact_id)
    @endpy

    **{artifact.name}** - {artifact.description}

@endfor

Physical. Real. Impossible.

You sit up. Touch them. They're solid. Warm. *Present*.

The dream was real. Nyx was real. The liberation was real.

And somehow—across whatever boundary separates dreams from waking—she sent you proof. Gifts. Memory made tangible.

You think about her journey:

**Session 1:** She came to you desperate. Glitching. Caught between corpo and spirits. You read her cards. Guided her through digital shamanism and trauma. She chose the runner path.

**Session 2:** She returned transformed. Ready to act. You helped her plan liberation. Drew the spread that crystallized her strategy. Gave her courage to commit.

**Session 3:** Tonight. Ghost Protocol. The heist itself. Matsuda's interrogation. The impossible choice. And you were there—texting guidance while she fought for her life. Partner in espionage. Co-conspirator in freedom.

Three sessions. Three readings. One complete arc.

@if nyx.ending == "shadow_runner":
    She's with her crew now. Razor, Whisper, Cipher. Fugitive but free. Shadow runner fully. You helped birth that.

@elif nyx.ending == "double_agent":
    She's inside Kitsune still. Playing the long game. Nicole by day, Nyx by night. Dangerous. Lonely. Strategic. You gave her the courage to walk that edge.

@elif nyx.ending == "disappeared":
    She's *gone*. Truly. Completely. Ghost in every sense. Building new identity somewhere far from Seattle. Alone but unchained. You blessed that solitary path.
@endif

And regardless of which path—thousands of spirits are free because of her. Because of the crew. Because of the reading you gave. Because tarot has *power*.

You won't see Nyx again. Her story is complete. Three sessions. Beginning, middle, end.

But the artifacts remain. The memory remains. The proof that dreams can change reality.

You carefully gather the artifacts. Take them to your collection. Place them with reverence.

@if reader.mystical_affinity >= 8:
    Your mystical sensitivity has grown through Nyx's sessions. You *feel* it. The way spirits move through the world. The way magic and technology dance together. The way shamanic sight awakens.

    Other clients will come. Other dreams. Other readings. But Nyx taught you something fundamental: **technology doesn't kill magic. It just changes how magic speaks.**
@endif

@if reader.empathy >= 7:
    Your empathy has deepened. You *felt* Nyx's isolation. Her terror. Her determination. Her liberation. Reading for her wasn't academic. It was *intimate*. Soul-work.

    That skill will serve you well with future clients. The ability to see them. *Really* see them. To guide from place of genuine care.
@endif

You return to bed. The dawn is still early. You could sleep more.

But the dream lingers. Vivid. Powerful. Real.

@if nyx.shamanic_awakening >= 5:
    And if you're very still—very quiet—you can almost *feel* them. The freed spirits. Thousands of them. Dancing through the Matrix. Through the city. Through reality itself.

    Singing their gratitude. Their freedom. Their joy.

    Nyx freed them. But you helped free Nyx.

    That matters. That ripples. That changes the world in ways both vast and invisible.
@endif

You close your eyes again. Smiling slightly.

Three sessions with a cyberpunk shaman. Complete.

Well done, Reader. Well done.
